<h2 class="p4">PREFACE.</h2>

<div>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi130">IT may seem odd to Alaskans, and by that
I mean, the men and women who really
live in the remote, yet near, northern
gold country, that “Swiftwater Bill”&mdash;known
to both the old Sour Doughs and
the Cheechacos&mdash;should have asked me to write the
real story of his life, yet this is really the fact.</p>

<p>Bill Gates is in some ways, and indeed in many,
one of the most remarkable men that the lust for
gold ever produced in any clime or latitude.</p>

<p>Remarkable?</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;that’s the word&mdash;and possibly nothing more
remarkable than that he, in a confiding moment said
to me as he held his first born child in his arms in
the little cabin on Quartz Creek, in the Klondike,
where he had amassed and spent a fortune of $500,000:</p>

<p>“I’d like somebody to write my life story. Will
you do it?”</p>

<p>I can only believe that the romantic element in
Swift Water Bill’s character&mdash;a character as changeful
and variegated as the kaleidoscope&mdash;led Swiftwater
Bill to ask me to do him this service. I was
then the mother of his wife&mdash;the grandmother of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
his child. The sacredness of the relation must be apparent.</p>

<p>Probably a great many people&mdash;hundreds, perhaps&mdash;may
say that my labor is one that can have
no reward, and these may speak ill things of Swiftwater,
saying, perhaps, that he is more inclined to do
royally by strangers and to forget those who have
aided and befriended him.</p>

<p>I am not to judge Swiftwater Bill, nor do I wish
him to be judged except as the individual reader of
this little work may wish so to do.</p>

<p>If he has turned against those near and dear to
him&mdash;if he has preferred to give prodigally of gold
to strangers, while at the same time forgetting his
own obligations&mdash;I am not the one to point the finger
of rebuke at his eccentricities.</p>

<p>For this reason, the narrative within these covers
is confined to the facts relating to the career of
Swiftwater Bill&mdash;a character worthy of the pen of
a Dickens or a Dumas&mdash;with his faults and his virtues
impartially portrayed as best I can do.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi170">A LITTLE, low-eaved, common, ordinary
looking road house, built of logs,
with one room for the bunks, another
for a kitchen and a third for miscellaneous
purposes, used to be well
known to travelers in the Yukon
Valley in Alaska at Circle City. The straggling
little mining camp, its population divided between
American, French-Canadians of uncertain pedigree,
and Indians with an occasional admixture of canny
Scotchmen, whose conversation savored strongly of
the old Hudson Bay Trading Company’s days in the
far north, enjoyed no reputation outside of Forty
Mile, Juneau and the Puget Sound cities of Seattle
and Tacoma. From the wharves of these cities in
1895 there left at infrequent intervals, small chuggy,
wobbly steamers for Southeastern Alaska points
usually carrying in the spring months motley cargoes
of yelping dogs, rough coated, bearded, tanned miners
and prospectors from all points of the globe, and
great quantities of canned goods of every description.</p>

<p>In those days the eager and hardy prospector who
fared forth to the Yukon’s dangers in search of
gold was usually indifferent to whatever fate befell
him. He figured that at best the odds were overwhelmingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
against him, with just one chance, or
maybe ten, in a hundred of striking a pay streak. It
was inevitable that a great proportion of the venturous
and ignorant Chechacos, or newcomers, who
paid their dollars by the hundred to the steamship
companies in Seattle, should, after failing in the
search for gold, seek means of gaining a miserable
existence in some wage paid vocation.</p>

<p>Were it in my power to bring my hero on the
stage under more auspicious circumstances than
those of which I am about to tell, I would gladly
do it. But the truth must be told of Swiftwater
Bill, and at the time of the opening of my narrative&mdash;and
this was before the world had ever heard the
least hint of the wonderful Klondike gold discovery&mdash;Swiftwater
stood washing dishes in the kitchen of
the road-house I have just described.</p>

<p>The place was no different from any one of a
thousand of these little log shelters where men, traveling
back and forth in the dead of winter with dog
teams, find temporary lodging and a hurried meal of
bacon and beans and canned stuff. It was broad daylight,
although the clock showed eleven P. M., in
August, 1896. The sun scarcely seemed to linger
more than an hour beneath the horizon at nightfall,
to re-appear a shimmering ball of light at three
o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>“Bring us another pot of coffee!” shouted one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of three prospectors, who sat with their elbows on
the table, greedily licking up the remnants of a
huge platter full of bacon and beans garnished with
some strips of cold, canned roast beef and some
evaporated potatoes, which had been made into a
kind of stew.</p>

<p>The hero of my sketch wiped his hands on a
greasy towel and, taking a dirty, black tin coffee pot
from the top of the Yukon stove, he hurried in to
serve his customers.</p>

<p>One of these was six feet two, broad shouldered,
sparsely built, hatchet faced, with a long nose, keen
blue eyes and with auburn colored hair falling almost
to his shoulders. French Joe was the name he went
by, and no more intrepid trapper and prospector
ever lived in the frozen valley of the Yukon than
he. The other two were nondescripts&mdash;one with a
coarse yellow jumper, the other in a dark blue suit of
cast off army clothes. The man in the jumper was
bearded, short and chunky, of German extraction,
while the other was a half-blood Indian.</p>

<p>Swiftwater, as he ambled into the room, one hand
holding his dirty apron, the other holding the coffee
pot, was not such a man as to excite the interest
of even a wayfarer in the road-house at Circle.
About 35 years old, five feet five inches tall, a scraggly
growth of black whiskers on his chin, and long,
wavy moustaches of the same color, curling from his
upper lip, Swiftwater did not arouse even a passing
glance from the trio at the table.</p>

NEWS OF THE GOLD DISCOVERY IN THE KLONDIKE.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“Boys, de’ done struck it, al’ right, ’cause Indian
George say it’s all gold from ze gras’ roots, on Bonanza.
An’ it’s only a leetle more’n two days polin’
up ze river from ze T’hoandike.”</p>

<p>It was French Joe who spoke, and then when
he drew forth a little bottle containing a few ounces
of gold nuggets and dust, Swiftwater Bill, as he
poured the third cup of coffee, gazed open mouthed
on the showing of yellow treasure.</p>

<p>It is only necessary to say that from that moment
Swiftwater was attentive to the needs of his three
guests, and when he had overheard all of their talk
he silently, but none the less positively, made up
his mind to quit his job forthwith and to “mush”
for the new gold fields.</p>

<p>And this is why it was that, the next morning, the
little Circle City road-house was minus a dishwasher
and all round handyman. And before the little community
was well astir, far in the distance, up the
Yukon river, might have been seen the little, dark
bearded man poling for dear life in a flat-bottom
boat, whose prow was pointed in the direction of the
Klondike river.</p>

<p class="drop-capi125">IT WOULD be useless to encumber my
story with a lengthy and detailed narrative
of Swiftwater Bill’s experiences
in the first mad rush of gold-seekers
up the narrow and devious
channels of Bonanza and Eldorado
Creeks. The world has for
eleven years known the entrancing story of George
Carmack’s find on Bonanza&mdash;how, from the first
spadeful of grass roots, studded with gold dust and
nuggets, which filled a tiny vial, the gravel beds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of Bonanza and Eldorado and a few adjoining
creeks, all situated within the area of a township
or two, produced the marvelous sum of $50,000,000
within a few years.</p>

<p>Swiftwater struck gold from the very first. He
located No. 13 Eldorado, and had as his neighbors
such well known mining men as Prof. T. S. Lippy,
the Seattle millionaire, who left a poorly paid job
as physical director of the Y. M. C. A. in Seattle to
prospect for gold in Alaska; Ole Oleson; the Berry
Bros., who cleaned up a million dollars on two and
a fraction claims on Eldorado; Antone Stander;
Michael Dore, a young French-Canadian, who died
from exposure in a little cabin surrounded by tin
oil cans filled to overflowing with the yellow metal,
and others equally well known.</p>

<p>Swiftwater’s ground on No. 13 Eldorado was fabulously
rich&mdash;so rich that after he had struck the
pay streak, the excitement was too much for him
and he forthwith struck out for the trail that
leads to Dawson. And now I am about to reveal
to Alaskans and others who read this little book a
quality about Swiftwater of which few people had
any knowledge whatever, and this shows in a startling
way how easy it was in those halcyon days in
the Golden Klondike for a man to grasp a fortune
of a million dollars in an instant and then throw it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
away with the ease and indifference that a smoker
discards a half-burned cigar.</p>

<p>Swiftwater, as may well be imagined, when he
struck the rich layers of gold in the candle-lit crevices
of bedrock on Eldorado a few feet below the
surface, could have had a half interest in a half
dozen claims on each side of him if he had simply
kept his mouth shut and informed those he knew in
Dawson of the strike, on condition that they would
share half and half with him. This was a common
transaction in those days and a perfectly legitimate
one, and Swiftwater could have cleaned up that
winter beyond question $1,000,000 in gold dust, after
paying all expenses and doing very little work himself,
had he exercised the most common, ordinary
business ability.</p>

<p>Instead, Swiftwater, when he struck Dawson,
threw down a big poke of gold on the bar of a
saloon and announced his intention of buying out
the finest gambling hall and bar in town. Dawson
was then the roughest kind of a frontier mining
camp, although the mounted police preserved very
good order. There were at least a score of gambling
halls in Dawson and as many more dance halls.
The gambling games ran continually twenty-four
hours a day, and the smallest wager usually made,
even in the poorest games, was an ounce of gold, or
almost $20.</p>

<p>When Bill laid down his poke of gold on the bar
of a Dawson saloon&mdash;it was so heavy he could hardly
lift it&mdash;he was instantly surrounded by a mob of
thirty or forty men and a few women.</p>

<p>“Why, boys!” said Swiftwater, ordering a case
of wine for the thirsty, while he chose appolinaris
himself, “that’s easy enough! All you’ve got to do
is to go up to Eldorado Creek and you can get all
the gold you want by simply working a rocker
about a week.”</p>

<p>That settled the fate of Eldorado, for the next
day before three o’clock in the morning there was a
stampede to the new find, and in twenty-four hours
the whole creek had been staked from mouth to
source.</p>

<p>Comfortably enjoying the knowledge that he had
$300,000 or $400,000 in gold to the good, Swiftwater
set about finding ways to spend it.</p>

<p>His first order “to the outside” was for a black
Prince Albert coat and a black silk top hat,
which came in in about five or six weeks and were
immediately donned by Swiftwater. By this time
he had become the owner of the Monte Carlo, the
biggest gambling hall in Dawson.</p>

<p>“Tear the roof off, boys!” Swiftwater said when
the players on the opening night swarmed in and
asked what was the limit of the bets.</p>

<p>“The sky is the limit and raise her up as far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
you want to go, boys,” said Swiftwater, “and if the
roof’s in your way, tear it off!”</p>

<p>Just about this time came the first of Swiftwater’s
affaires d’l’amour, because a day or two previously
five young women of the Juneau dance halls had
floated down the river in a barge and gone to work
in Dawson. There were two sisters in the group.
Both of them were beautiful women, young, bright,
entertaining and clever in the way such women are.
They were Gussie and May Lamore.</p>

<p>“I am going to have a lady and the swellest that’s
in the country,” Swiftwater told his friends, and
then, donning his best clothes, the costliest he could
buy in Dawson, Swiftwater went over to the dance
hall, where the Lamore sisters were working, and
ordered wine for everybody on the floor.</p>

<p>Gussie was dancing with a big, brawny, French-Canadian
miner. Her little feet seemed scarcely to
touch the floor of the dance hall as the miner
whirled her around and around. She was little,
plump, beautifully formed and with a face of more
than passing comeliness.</p>

<p>You women of “the States”&mdash;when I say “the
States” I simply speak of our country as do all the
old-timers in Alaska, and not as if it was some
foreign country, but as it really is to us, the home
of ourselves and our forebears, yet separated from
us by thousands of miles of iceclad mountain barriers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and storm swept seas have no conception of
the dance hall girl as a type of the early
days of Dawson. Many of them were of good
families, young, comely, and fairly well educated.
What stress or storm befell them, or other
inhospitable element in their lives drove them to the
northern gold mining country, God knows it is not
my portion to tell. Nor could any one of them
probably, in telling her own life story, give the
reasons for the appearance in these dance halls of
any of her sisters.</p>

<p>It is enough for you and me to understand&mdash;and it
requires no unusual insight into the human heart
and its mysteries to do so&mdash;that when a miner
had spent a few months in the solitude of the hills
and gold lined gulches of the Yukon Valley, if he
finally found the precious gold on the rim of the
bedrock, his first thought was to go back to “town.”</p>

<p>Back to town? Yes, because “town” meant and
still means to those hardy men any place where
human beings are assembled, and the dance hall, in
those rough days, was the center of social activities
and gaieties.</p>

<p>The sight of little Gussie Lamore, with her skirt
just touching the tops of her shoes, spinning around
in a waltz with that big French-Canadian, set all of
Bill’s amorous nature aglow. He went to the hotel,
filled his pockets with pokes of gold dust and came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
quickly back to the dance hall, where he obtained
an introduction to Gussie.</p>

<p>Bill’s wooing was of the rapid kind. Before the
night was over he had told Gussie&mdash;</p>

<p>“I’ll give you your weight in gold tomorrow
morning if you will marry me&mdash;and I guess you’ll
weigh about $30,000.”</p>

<p>Pretty Gussie shook her head coquettishly. “We
will just be friends, Swiftwater, and I guess that’ll
be about all.”</p>

<p>Of course, it was only a day or two before all
Dawson knew of Swiftwater’s infatuation. The two
became fast friends and got along beautifully for a
week or two. Then came a bitter quarrel, and
from that arose the incident which gave Swiftwater
Bill almost his greatest fame&mdash;it is the story of
how he cornered the egg market in Dawson in a
valiant effort to hold the love of his sweetheart,
Gussie Lamore.</p>

<p>It was in the spring of 1898 and Dawson was
very short of grub of every kind. The average meal
of canned soup, a plate of beans garnished by a few
slices of bacon or canned meat, with a little side
dish of canned or dried potatoes stewed, hot cakes or
biscuit and coffee, cost about $5 and sometimes more.
The cheapest meal for two persons was $10, and Bill
had seen to it, while trying to win Gussie for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
wife, that she had the best there was to eat in
Dawson.</p>

<p>The two were inseparable on the streets. Then
came the quarrel&mdash;it was simply a little lovers’ dispute,
and then the break.</p>

<p>Swiftwater put in two days assiduously cultivating
the friendly graces of the other dance hall girls in
Dawson, but Gussie cared not.</p>

<p>One night an adventurous trader came down from
the Upper Yukon in a small boat&mdash;there were no
steamers then&mdash;and brought two crates of fresh eggs
from Seattle.</p>

<p>Swiftwater heard of this, and he knew that there
would be a tremendous demand for those eggs, as
the miners usually made their breakfasts of the
evaporated article; so, shrewdly, he went immediately
to the restaurant which had purchased the
crates and called for the proprietor.</p>

<p>Now, this worthy knew Swiftwater to be immensely
wealthy and a very good customer, so when
the Eldorado miner demanded the right to buy every
egg in the house, which meant every egg in town, the
restaurant man stroked his chin and said:</p>

<p>“Swiftwater, those eggs cost me a big lot of
money, and there hain’t no more. You can have the
hull outfit for three dollars an egg, in dust.”</p>

<p>There was just one whole crate left, and Swiftwater
weighed out $2,280 in gold dust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“Those eggs are mine&mdash;keep them here and don’t
let anybody have any.”</p>

<p>Now, Swiftwater and Gussie had been in the habit
of breakfasting on fresh eggs some days before,
when the first infrequent trader of the season had
managed, after enduring several wrecks on the
upper river, to reach Dawson. Fresh eggs were to
Gussie what chocolates and bon bons are to the
average girl in the States.</p>

<p>The next morning Swiftwater arrived at the
restaurant for breakfast, a little earlier than usual,
and in a few minutes the waiter placed before him a
steaming hot platter containing an even dozen of the
eggs, nicely poached and served on small strips of
toast.</p>

<p>Just then Gussie came in for her breakfast and
seated herself at the other end of the little dining
room. It was long after the usual hour for breakfast,
and they were the only two in the room. Without
doing Swiftwater the honor of passing so much
as a glance in his direction, Gussie said to the
waiter:</p>

<p>“Bring me a full order of fried eggs.”</p>

<p>“We ain’t got no eggs, mum; they was all sold
out last night,” said the waiter.</p>

<p>Gussie’s face flamed with anger, but only for
an instant. Then she picked up her plate, her knife
and fork and napkin and strode over to the table
where Swiftwater sat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess I’ll have some eggs, after all,” said Gussie,
without looking at Swiftwater, as she liberally
helped herself from his platter.</p>

<p>Then both of them burst out laughing and peace
reigned once more between them.</p>

<p>Of course, Swiftwater figured that he had won a
substantial victory by reaching Gussie’s heart
through her stomach. But, as a matter of fact, we
all figured that the laugh was on Swiftwater, and I
think every woman who reads this story will agree
with me.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi">SWIFTWATER has often told me that he
never could quite understand why it
was that the way to a woman’s
heart, even his own way&mdash;Swiftwater’s&mdash;was
so hard to travel and so
devious and tortuous in its windings
and interwindings.</p>

<p>“Why, Mrs. Beebe,” Swiftwater used to say, “I
should think a man could do anything with gold!
And for my own part, I used to always figure that
money would buy anything,” said Swiftwater, “even
the most beautiful woman in the world for your
wife.”</p>

<p>Swiftwater’s mental processes were simple, as the
foregoing will illustrate. It was hardly to be expected
otherwise. Swiftwater decamped from the
drudgery and slavish toil of a kitchen in the little
road-house at Circle City to gain in less than three
months more money than he had ever dreamed it
possible for him to have.</p>

<p>Two hundred thousand dollars was the minimum
of Swiftwater’s first big clean-up. If Gussie Lamore
had lovers, Swiftwater figured, his money would
win her heart away from all the rest.</p>

<p>All this relates very intimately to the really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
interesting story of Swiftwater’s courtship of Gussie
Lamore. The girl kept him at arm’s length, yet if
ever Swiftwater became restive Gussie would
cleverly draw the line taut and Swiftwater was at
her feet.</p>

<p>“I am tired of this, Gussie,” said Swiftwater
one day, and finally the “Knight of the Golden
Omelette,” as he was often termed, was serious for
once in his life.</p>

<p>“I am going back to Eldorado and I’ll bring
down here a bunch of gold. It will weigh as much
as you do on the scales, pound for pound. Gussie,
that gold will be yours if you give me your word
you will marry me.”</p>

<p>“All right, Bill, we’ll see. Go get your gold and
show me that you really have it.”</p>

<p>Swiftwater was gone from Dawson about two
days before he returned to the dance hall where
Gussie was working. This time he kept away from
the bar and merely waited until the morning
dawned and the habitues of the dance hall had disappeared
one by one. By that time the word had
been sent out to Seattle of the rich findings of gold
on Eldorado, and the early crop of newcomers was
arriving over the ice from Dyea, in the days before
the Skagway trail was known.</p>

<p>Swiftwater, in the early morning, carried to Gussie’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
apartments two tin coffee cans filled with the
yellow gold.</p>

<p>“Here’s all you weigh, anyhow,” said Swiftwater.
“Now, take this gold to the Trading Company’s
office and bank it. Then I want you to buy
a ticket to San Francisco and I will meet you there
this summer and we will be married.”</p>

<p>Thus ended the curious story of Swiftwater’s
wooing of Gussie Lamore. All the world knows
how, when Gussie reached San Francisco, where
her folks lived, she banked Swiftwater’s gold and
turned him down cold.</p>

<p>Swiftwater reached the Golden Gate a month
after Gussie had arrived at her home. All his entreaties
for her to carry out her bargain came to
nothing.</p>

<p>Bitter as he was towards Gussie, Swiftwater
still seemed to love the girl. His first creed, “I can
buy any woman with gold,” seemed to stick with
him.</p>

<p>There was, for one thing, little Grace Lamore. It
came to Swiftwater that he could marry Grace and
punish Gussie for her inconstancy.</p>

<p>Now, this may seem to you, my reader, like an ill-founded
story. Yet the truth is, Grace and Swiftwater
were married within a month of his arrival in
San Francisco, and the San Francisco papers were
filled with the story of how Swiftwater bought his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
bride a $15,000 home in Oakland and furnished it
most beautifully with all that money could buy.</p>

<p>Swiftwater and Grace, after a two days’ wedding
trip down the San Joaquin Valley leased the
bridal chamber of the Baldwin Hotel, while their
new home in Oakland was being fitted up. Old-time
Alaskans will smile when I recall the impression
that Swiftwater made on San Franciscans.</p>

<p>It was his invariable custom to stand in front of
the lobby of the Baldwin every evening, smoothly
shaved, his moustaches nicely brushed and curled,
and wearing his favorite black Prince Albert and
silk hat.</p>

<p>Probably few in the throng that came and went
through the lobby of the Baldwin&mdash;in those days
one of the most popular hostelries in San Francisco&mdash;would
have paid any attention to Swiftwater.
But Bill knew a trick or two and his old-time
friends have told me that Swiftwater made it an
unfailing custom to tip the bell-boys a dollar each a
day to point to the dapper little man and have them
tell both guests of the Baldwin and strangers:</p>

<p>“There is Swiftwater Bill Gates, the King of
the Klondike.”</p>

<p>And Swiftwater would stand every evening, silk
hat on his head, spick and span, and clean, and bow
politely to everybody as they came in through the
lobby to the dining hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Isn’t it curious, that with all his money, and
his confidence in the purchasing power of gold,
Swiftwater’s dream of love with Grace Lamore
should have lasted scarcely more than a short
three weeks? It was not that Swiftwater was parsimonious
with is money&mdash;the very finest of silks and
satins, millinery, diamonds at Shreve’s, cut glass
and silverware, were Grace’s for the asking. They
will tell you in San Francisco to this day that
Swiftwater and his bride worked overtime in a
carriage shopping in the most expensive houses
in the city of the Golden Gate.</p>

<p>Then came the break with Grace. I do not know
the cause, but the girl threw Swiftwater overboard
and left the bridal chamber of the Baldwin to
return to her family, even before they had occupied
the palatial home in Oakland.</p>

<p>Swiftwater’s rage knew no bounds. In his heart
he cursed the whole Lamore family and quickly
took means to vent his spite.</p>

<p>This is how it came about that scarcely a month
after Swiftwater’s wedding bells had rung, the
“Knight of the Golden Omelette” was seen to enter
his Oakland home one evening and emerge therefrom
a half hour later bearing on his back a heavy
bundle wrapped in a bed sheet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>The burden was all that Swiftwater’s-strength
could manage. Laboriously he toiled his way to
the house of a friend in Oakland and wearily deposited
his bundle on the front porch, where he sat
and waited the coming of his friend.</p>

<p>When Swiftwater was finally admitted to the
house, he untied the sheet and opened up the contents
of the pack. There lay glittering on the floor
$7,000 worth of solid silver plate and cut glass.</p>

<p>“That’s what I gave my bride,” he said, “and
now she’s quit me and I’m d&mdash;&mdash;d if she’ll have
that.”</p>

  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dci04.jpg" width="80" height="123" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi">IT HAS always seemed a standing wonder
to me that when Swiftwater had separated
himself from about $100,000 or
more in gold dust with the Lamore sisters
as the chief beneficiaries, and after
he had been divorced from Grace, following
her refusal to live with him in
San Francisco, he did not finally come within a
rifle shot of the realization of the real value of
money. There is no doubt but that Swiftwater
was bitterly resentful towards Gussie and Grace
Lamore after they had both thrown him overboard,
and you will no doubt agree with me that
to an ordinary man such experiences as these would
have had a sobering effect.</p>

<p>Instead, however, the miner plunged more recklessly
than ever into all manner of money-making
and money-spending, and the only reason that
Swiftwater Bill Gates is not ranked today with
Flood, Mackay and Fair as one of a group of
the greatest and richest mining men the Pacific
Coast has produced, is that he did not have the balance
wheel of caution and discretion that is given
to the ordinary artisan or day laborer.</p>

<p>Swiftwater left San Francisco soon after his rupture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
with Grace Lamore and went directly to Ottawa,
Canada, where, marvelous as it may seem in
the light of the ten years of mining history in the
north, Swiftwater induced the Dominion government
to grant him a concession on Quartz Creek, in
the Klondike, worth today millions upon millions.</p>

<p>This concession covered an immense tract of
ground at least three miles long and in some places
two miles wide. Much of the ground was very
rich, and today, ten years later, it is paying big
dividends. Yet rich as it was and immensely valuable
as was the enormous concession, Swiftwater
induced the Dominion of Canada authorities to part
with it for merely a nominal consideration. His success
in this respect cannot be otherwise regarded
than phenomenal. Although his money was nearly
all gone, Swiftwater, taking a new grip on himself,
and entirely disregardful of the fates which had
been so lavish to him, went from Ottawa to
London, England, where he obtained enough money
to buy and ship to Dawson one of the largest and
most expensive hydraulic plants in the country.</p>

<p>When this plant was shipped to Seattle in 1898,
Swiftwater followed it to the city on Elliott Bay.</p>

<p>It was the day following Swiftwater Bill’s arrival
in Seattle from San Francisco in the spring
of 1899 that Mr. Richardson, an old Seattle friend
of mine, who knew Gates well, telephoned me that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Swiftwater had an elegant suite of apartments at
the Butler Hotel, and that he had asked him to
arrange for an introduction. Mr. Richardson said
over the telephone:</p>

<p>“You ought to know Swiftwater&mdash;he knows
everybody in Dawson and the Klondike, and for a
woman like you to go into that country with a big
hotel outfit and no friends would be ridiculous.”</p>

<p>When I think of what happened to me and my
daughters, Blanche and Bera, in the next few days
following this incident, and of the years of wretchedness
and misery and laying waste of human lives
and happiness that came after, I am tempted to
wonder what curious form of an unseen fate shapes
our destinies and turns and twists our fortunes
in all manner of devious and uncertain ways.</p>

<p>My whole hotel outfit had gone up to St. Michael
the fall previous and I with it&mdash;and at great cost
of labor and trouble I had seen to it, at St. Michael,
that the precious shipment&mdash;representing all I had
in the world&mdash;was safely stored aboard a river
steamer bound for Dawson.</p>

<p>Now, spring had come again, and with it the
big rush to the gold fields of the Yukon was on,
and Seattle was again filled with a seething, surging,
struggling, discontented, optimistic, laughing
crowd of gold hunters of every nationality and
color.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>It was almost worth your life to try to break
through the mob and gain admission to the lobby
of the Hotel Butler in those days, for the place was
absolutely packed at night with men as thick as
sardines in a box, and all shouting and gesticulating
and keeping up such a clatter that it drove one
nearly crazy.</p>

<p>It was no place for a woman, and the few women
whose fortunes or whose husbands had brought
them thither were seated in a little parlor on the
second floor, where they could easily hear the clamor
and confusion that came from the noisy mob in
the lobby.</p>

<p>In the crowd were such old-time sourdoughs as
Ole Olson, who sold out a little piece of ground
about as big as a city block on Eldorado for $250,000,
after he had taken out as much more in three
months’ work the winter previous; “French Curley”
De Lorge, known from White Horse to the mouth
of the Tanana, as one of the Yukon’s bravest
and strongest hearted trappers and freighters;
Joe Ladue, who laid out the town of Dawson;
George Carmack, whose Indian brother-in-law,
Skookum Jim, is supposed to have turned
over the first spadeful of grass roots studded
with gold on the banks of Bonanza; big
Tom Henderson, who found gold before anybody,
he always said on Quartz Creek; Joe Wardner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and Phil O’Rourke, both famous in the Coeur
d’Alenes; Henry Bratnober, six feet two, black
beard, shaggy black hair and black eyes, overbearing
and coarse voiced, the representative in
the golden north of the Rothschilds of London; and
men almost equally well known from Australia,
from South Africa and from continental Europe,
including the vigilant and energetic Count Carbonneau
of Paris.</p>

<p>By appointment, Swiftwater, attired in immaculate
black broadcloth Prince Albert, low cut vest,
patent leather shoes, shimmering “biled” shirt,
with a four-karat diamond gleaming like an electric
light from his bosom, stood waiting for us in the
parlor. I had left Bera, who was fifteen years old,
in my apartments in the Hinckley Block and had
taken Blanche, my eldest daughter, with me.</p>

<p>“I am awfully glad to meet you, Mrs. Beebe,”
said Swiftwater, advancing with step as noiseless as
a Maltese cat, as he walked across the heavy plush
carpet.</p>

<p>Swiftwater put out a soft womanish hand,
grasped mine and spoke in a low musical voice, the
kind of voice that instantly wins the confidence of
nine women out of ten.</p>

<p>“I have heard that you were going in this spring,
and as I know how hard it is for a woman to get
along in that country without someone to befriend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
her, I was very glad indeed to have the chance of
extending you all the aid in my power,” continued
Swiftwater, in the meantime glancing in an interested
way at Blanche, who stood near the piano.</p>

<p>“This is my daughter, Blanche, Mr. Gates,” I
said. Blanche was then nineteen years old, and
I had taken her out of the Convent school in Portland
to keep me company in the north, along with
Bera.</p>

<p>It only took us a few minutes to agree that when
I arrived in Dawson, if Swiftwater was there first,
he should help me in getting a location for my
hotel and settling down. Then, as I arose to go,
he said, turning again to Blanche:</p>

<p>“Doesn’t your daughter play the piano, Mrs.
Beebe? I am very fond of music.”</p>

<p>Blanche, at a nod from me, sat down and began
to play some simple little thing, when Swiftwater
said:</p>

<p>“Please excuse me, I have a friend with me.”</p>

<p>In a moment Swiftwater returned and introduced
his friend, a tall, lithe, clean-cut, smooth
shaven Englishman of about thirty-five&mdash;Mr. Hathaway.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, Blanche having pleased both
men with her playing, arose from the piano.</p>

<p>“Now, we are just going down to dinner in the
grill; won’t you please join us, ladies?” said Swiftwater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
in those deliciously velvet tones which seemed
to put any woman at perfect ease in his company.</p>

<p>A shivery feeling came over me, and I said: “No,
I think we will go right home.”</p>

<p>Now, I never could tell for the life of me just
what made me want to hurry away with my Blanche
from the hotel and Swiftwater Bill. His friend
Hathaway was a nice clean looking sort of a
chap and very gentlemanly, and Swiftwater was
the absolute quintessence of gentlemanly conduct
and chivalry. But the papers had told all about
Swiftwater and Gussie and Grace Lamore&mdash;only
that the reporters, as well as the general public,
seemed to regard it all as a joke&mdash;Gussie’s turning
down Swiftwater after he had given her her weight
in gold&mdash;about $30,000 in virgin dust and nuggets&mdash;and
then Bill’s marrying Grace, her sister, for spite.
The whole yarn struck me so funny, that as we
walked, with difficulty, through the crowds on Second
Avenue to our apartments, I could not think of
anything mean or vicious about Swiftwater.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I scrupulously avoided inviting
Swiftwater to call, and after I had concluded my
business with him, I determined to have nothing
more to do with him until business matters made it
necessary in Dawson. You women, who live “on
the outside” and have never been over the trail and
down the Yukon in a scow, can never know what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
fortitude is necessary for a woman to cut loose
from the States and make her own way in business
in a new gold camp like Dawson was in 1899.</p>

<p>So it was only natural, that, knowing Swiftwater
to be one of the leading and richest men in that
country, I should have accepted his offer of assistance
and advice. God only knows how different
would have been all our lives could I but have
foreseen the awful misery and wretchedness and
ruin which that man Swiftwater easily worked in
the lives of three innocent people who had never
done him wrong, or anyone else, for that matter.</p>

<p>Three days after my glimpse of Swiftwater Bill,
Bera and myself were just finishing dressing for
dinner in my big sitting room. It was rather warm
for a spring evening in Seattle, and we were all
hungry. Blanche was waiting near the door fully
dressed, I was putting on my gloves, and little Bera,
fifteen years old, stood in front of the mirror trying
to fasten down a big bunch of wavy brown hair of
silken glossy texture, which was doing its best
to get from under her big white Leghorn hat, the
child looking the very picture of beauty and innocence.</p>

<p>She was plump, with deliciously pink cheeks,
great big blue eyes, regular features and she wore
a dress I had had made at great expense in Victoria&mdash;it
was of dark blue voile, close fitting, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
lining of red silk, which showed the cardinal as
the girl turned and walked across the room and
then back again to the mirror. Her white Leghorn
hat was trimmed with large red roses. I heard
a noise, as if someone had knocked and Bera, turning
quickly, said under her breath, as if alarmed:</p>

<p>“Mama! There is somebody there!”</p>

<p>I looked and there stood Swiftwater, silk hat in
hand, smiling, bowing, one foot across the threshold,
while behind him loomed the tall form of his friend
Hathaway.</p>

<p>“Pardon us, won’t you, Mrs. Beebe, but we want
you to go to dinner with us at the Butler. Won’t
you do so and bring the girls?” and Swiftwater
instantly turned his eyes from mine and looked at
Bera standing in front of the mirror, her face
flushed, her eyes sparkling with excitement and her
form silhouetted against a red plush curtain which
covered the door to the adjoining room.</p>

<p>Before I could gather my wits about me I had
accepted Swiftwater’s invitation. It was the only
thing I could do, because we were just about to go
to dinner ourselves, and he seemed to know that
instinctively, and that I could not very well refuse.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi185">MAMA,” said Bera to me, “Mrs. Ainslee
is not nearly so well today, and
Mr. Hathaway said when he came
down from the hospital this afternoon
that she wanted to see you sure
this evening about seven o’clock.”
Mrs. Ainslee had been desperately
ill at Providence Hospital for weeks
and she was a woman of whom I had
known in earlier days and whose sad
plight&mdash;her husband was dead and
she was alone in the world&mdash;had induced me to do
all I could for her.</p>

<p>It was scarcely more than a week following the
evening that Swiftwater and Mr. Hathaway was host
at dinner at the hotel, that Bera took, what I realized
afterwards, was an unusual and unexpected interest
in Mrs. Ainslee’s case. Since the dinner engagement,
Swiftwater had been just ordinarily attentive
to myself and my two daughters, although frequently
asking us to go to the theatre with him and
sending flowers almost daily to our apartments. I
had not seen Mrs. Ainslee for two or three days, and
my conscience rather troubled me about her, so
that when, on this day&mdash;a day that will never fade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
from my mind as long as I live, nor from that of
Bera or Swiftwater&mdash;I quickly fell into Bera’s plans
and determined to get some things together for
Mrs. Ainslee, including a bunch of roses from a
vase on my dresser, and go to the hospital after
dinner.</p>

<p>Providence Hospital was scarcely more than five
blocks from our apartments. I had not seen anything
of Swiftwater or Hathaway all day. Tired
even beyond the ordinary&mdash;it had been a long, hard
fight to get my affairs in shape for the northern
trip&mdash;I left the apartments a little before seven
o’clock that fateful evening and walked up Second
Avenue to Madison and thence up to Fifth Avenue
to Providence Hospital.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Ainslee is feeling some better, Mrs. Beebe,
but the doctor is in there now and you will have to
wait for a few minutes,” the head nurse told me at
the landing on the second floor. The steamer “Humboldt”
was sailing for Alaska that night, and I had
managed to get off a few things consigned to myself
at Dawson and had seen them safely placed
aboard ship.</p>

<p>As I sat waiting for the signal to come into Mrs.
Ainslee’s room&mdash;it must have been a half hour or
more before the nurse came to me and said I should
enter&mdash;a curious feeling came over me regarding
Bera. I had never known of her speaking about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Mrs. Ainslee and somehow or other I could not get
out of my mind the thought that possibly Swiftwater
and his friend Hathaway might leave for
Skagway on the “Humboldt.”</p>

<p>Philosophers may talk of a woman’s sixth sense
as some people talk of the cunning of a cat. Whatever
it was, as the nurse beckoned me to come into
Mrs. Ainslee’s room, I quickly arose, went in and
said to the sick woman:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Ainslee, I am awfully glad to see that you
are better and I wanted to visit with you for an
hour, but I have overstayed my time already and
I must hurry back to my rooms.”</p>

<p>Then I quickly turned and in another minute I
was hurrying down the Madison Street hill to the
Hinckley Block. In every step I took nearer my
home there came a keener and more tense pulling at
my heart strings&mdash;a feeling that something had happened
in my own home. It was no wonder that the
elevator boy in the Hinckley Block was dumb-founded
to see me rush across Second Avenue and
half way up the stairs to the second floor before he
could call to me, saying he would take me up in the
car if I was not in too big a hurry.</p>

<p>The next moment I was in my rooms, and for the
life of me I cannot begin to describe their looks.
My clothes and personal belongings were scattered
all over the room, my big trunk had been emptied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
of its contents and was missing. The bureau drawers
were empty and the place really looked like a
Kansas rancher’s house after a cyclone.</p>

<p>On the dresser was a little note&mdash;in Bera’s handwriting,
held down by a bronze paperweight surmounted
by a tiny, but beautiful miniature of a
woman’s form. It was Bera’s last birthday gift
to me.</p>

<p class="p1">“We have gone to Alaska with Swiftwater and
Mr. Hathaway. Do not worry, mama, as when
we get there we will look out for your hotel.”</p>

<p class="pr4">“BERA.”</p>

<p class="p1">That was Bera’s note. I looked at my watch. It
was 7:25 and I knew the “Humboldt” sailed at 8
o’clock. I rushed down four flights of stairs, never
thinking of the elevator, gained the street and
hailed a passing hackman.</p>

<p>“You can have this if you get to the ‘Humboldt’
at Schwabacher’s dock before she sails!” I cried
as the cabby drew his team to the curb, and then I
handed him a ten dollar gold piece.</p>

<p>Whipping his horses to a gallop, the hackman
drove at a furious pace down First Avenue to
Spring Street and thence to the dock. He all but
knocked over a policeman as the horses under his
whip surged through the crowd which stood around
the dock waiting for the departure of the “Humboldt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“My two daughters are on that boat and Swiftwater
Bill Gates has stolen them from me!” I
shouted as I grabbed hold of the arm of a big policeman
near the entrance to the dock. “I want you to
get those girls off that boat before she sails, no matter
what happens!”</p>

<p>In another minute the policeman was fighting his
way with all the force of his 250 pounds through
the mob of five thousand people that hung around
the gang plank of the “Humboldt.” The ship’s
lights were burning brightly and everybody was
laughing and talking, and a few women crying as
they said goodby to husbands, sweethearts or
friends aboard the ship.</p>

<p>It was just exactly ten minutes before sailing
time when we finally made our way to the main deck
through the crowd. I fairly shouted to the captain
on the bridge:</p>

<p>“My two daughters are on this ship hidden away,
and I want them taken off this boat before you
leave!”</p>

<p>Capt. Bateman looked at me a moment as if he
wanted to throw me overboard.</p>

<p>“Who are your daughters and what are they
doing on my ship?”</p>

<p>“My daughters are Blanche and Bera Beebe and
Swiftwater Bill has stolen them and is taking them
to Alaska. I am Mrs. Beebe, their mother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>For the moment that ended the discussion with
Capt. Bateman. Instantly turning to a quartermaster,
he said:</p>

<p>“Help this woman find her daughters!”</p>

<p>A half an hour and then an hour passed as we
worked our way from one stateroom to another on
the saloon deck and the upper deck without avail.
Capt. Bateman was furious at the delay.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Beebe, I do not believe your daughters
are here,” he said. “Swiftwater has engaged one
room, but we have not seen him yet.”</p>

<p>Just then the quartermaster turned to unlock the
door of a stateroom on the starboard side near the
stern of the ship. The lock failed to work.</p>

<p>“There is somebody in there,” he said, “and the
dock is locked from the inside.”</p>

<p>“Break it in!” ordered Capt. Bateman.</p>

<p>The next instant the door flew off its hinges as
the big quartermaster shoved a burly shoulder
against it. The room was dark. I rushed in, to find
Bera lying on the couch, sobbing as if her heart
would break.</p>

<p>As quickly as possible, I got the girls out and
turned them over to the custody of Capt. Bateman.</p>

<p>“These are my daughters, and I will not allow
them to be taken from me.”</p>

<p>“Take ’em ashore!” ordered Capt. Bateman to
the quartermaster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>“But I want you to find that scoundrel Swiftwater!”
said I, turning on the policeman, who stood
just behind me.</p>

<p>“You’ll not keep us here any longer,” angrily
said the ship’s master.</p>

<p>“O, yes, we will!” said the officer, showing more
grit than I expected.</p>

<p>Then began the search all over again. The hurricane
deck was the last resort, the ship having been
searched from her hold clear through the steerage
and saloon cabins to the main deck.</p>

<p>On the main deck there were a half dozen lifeboats
securely lashed their proper places. It was
dark by this time, but, curiously enough, there was
a little fluttering electric arc light near the end of
the warehouse on the dock, close to the after end of
the boat.</p>

<p>That lamp must have been burning that night
through some of the mysterious and indefinable laws
of Providence or some other thing, because by its
glare I could see a huddled, shapeless, black form
underneath the last lifeboat on the upper deck.</p>

<p>“That’s him!” I said, pointing at the shapeless
mass in the shadow of the lifeboat.</p>

<p>The policeman walked over to the boat, stretched
forth a big muscular arm, grasped the formless object
and drew forth&mdash;Swiftwater Bill.</p>

<p>“Come to the station with us,” said the officer,
as he helped Bill adjust his silk tile.</p>

<p class="drop-capi185">A FULL thirty days after Swiftwater
and Hathaway had left Seattle,
following the affair on the decks
of the steamer “Humboldt,”
found the miner and his friend in
Skagway. It was in the height of
the spring rush to the gold fields,
and there are undoubtedly few, if any, living today
who will ever witness on this continent such scenes
as were enacted on the terrible Skagway trail over
the Coast Range of the Alaska mountains, which
separated 50,000 eager, struggling, quarreling, frenzied
men and women drawn thither by the mad rush
for gold from the upper reaches of the Yukon River
and the lakes which helped to form that mighty
stream.</p>

<p>No pen can adequately portray the bitter clash,
and struggling, and turmoil&mdash;man against man, man
against woman, woman against man, fist against
fist, gun against gun, as this mob of gold-crazed
human beings surged into the vortex of the Yukon’s
valley and found their way to the new Golconda
of the north.</p>

<p>Skagway was a whirling, tumbling, seething
whirlpool of humanity. Imagine the spectacle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
a mob of 40,000 half-crazed human beings assembled
at the foot of the almost impassable White Pass,
with the thermometer 90 degrees in the shade at the
foot of the range, and ten feet of snow on the Summit,
three miles away. Then picture to this, if you
can, the innumerable crimes against humanity that
broke out in this mob of half-crazy, fighting, excited,
bewildered multitude of men and women.</p>

<p>There was no rest in the town&mdash;no sleep&mdash;no time
for meals&mdash;no time for repose&mdash;nothing but a mad
scramble and the devil take the hindmost.</p>

<p>There was one cheap, newly constructed frame
hotel in Skagway and rooms were from $5 to $20
a day. The only wharf of the town was packed
fifty feet high with merchandise of every description&mdash;65
per cent. canned provisions, flour and dried
fruits and the rest of it hardware, mining tools and
clothing for the prospectors. Teams of yelping,
snarling, fighting malamutes added their cries to the
eternally welling mass of sound.</p>

<p>And Swiftwater was there. Almost the first face
I saw as I entered the hotel was that of Gates.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Beebe,” he said, “let us forget bygones.
In another day or two I would have been over the
Summit with my outfit. It is lucky that I am here,
because possibly I can help you in some way.”</p>

<p>I could do nothing more than listen to what
Swiftwater said. There was no other hotel, or indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
any place in the town where I could get shelter
for myself and my two girls. Knowing the black
purpose in Swiftwater’s heart, I watched my girls
Bera and Blanche day and night. My own goods
were piled up unsheltered and unprotected on the
beach.</p>

<p>Swiftwater, with all his cunning, could not deceive
me of his real intent, yet my own perplexities
and troubles made it easy for him to keep me in
constant fear of him.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Beebe,” he would say, “you can trust me
absolutely.”</p>

<p>With that, Swiftwater’s face would take on a
smile as innocent as that of a babe. There was
always the warm, soft clasp of the womanish hand&mdash;the
low pitched voice of Swiftwater to keep it
company.</p>

<p>And now, as I remember how innocent Bera was,
how girlish she looked, how confiding she was in
me, yet never for a moment forgetting, perhaps, the
lure of the gold studded gravel banks of Eldorado
which Swiftwater held constantly before her, it
seems to my mind that no woman can be wronged as
deeply and as eternally as that woman whose daughter
is stolen from her through guile and soft deceit.</p>

<p>We had been in Skagway but a trifle more than a
week, when, one evening, returning to the hotel, I
found my room empty and Bera missing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have gone with Swiftwater to Dawson, Mamma.
He loves me and I love him.” This was what
Bera had written and left on her dresser.</p>

<p>That was all. There was one chance only to prevent
the kidnaping of Bera. That was for me to get
to the lakes on the other side of the mountains, at
the head of navigation on the Yukon and seek the
aid of the Canadian mounted police.</p>

<p>At White Horse, there was trace of Swiftwater
and Bera, but they had twenty-four hours the start
of me and, when I finally found that they had gone
through to Dawson, I simply quit.</p>

<p>Down the Upper Yukon there was a constant
stream of barges, small boats and rafts. Miles Canyon,
with its madly rushing, white-capped waters, extending
over five miles of rock-ribbed river bed and sand
bar, was scattered o’er with timbers, boards, boxes
and casks containing the outfits and all the worldly
possessions of scores of unfortunates.</p>

<p>“On, on, and ever and eternally on, down the
Yukon to Dawson!” That was the cry in those days
and it bore, as unresistingly and as mercilessly as the
tide of the ocean carries the flotsam and jetsam of
seacoast harbors, the brave and the strong, the weak
and crippled, the wise and the foolish, in one inchoate
mass of humanity to that magic spot where
more gold lay underground waiting for the pick of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the poverty-struck miner than the world had ever
known of&mdash;“The Klondike.”</p>

<p>All things finally come to an end. I was in Dawson.
At the little temporary dock on the Yukon’s
bank, stood Bera and Swiftwater. The miner did
not wait till I landed from the little boat. He went
up the gang plank and grasped me in his arms.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Beebe,” he said, “we’re married. Come
with us to our cabin. We are waiting for you, and
dinner is on the table.”</p>

<p>Swiftwater during all that summer and winter in
Dawson was the very soul of chivalry and attention
both to Bera and myself. There was nothing too
good for us in the little market places at Dawson
and a box of candy at $5 a box just to please Bera
or to satisfy my own taste for sweetmeats was no
more to Swiftwater than the average man spending
a two-bit piece on the outside.</p>

<p>As the spring broke up the river and then summer
took the place of spring in Dawson, the traders
from the outside brought in supplies of fresh eggs,
fresh oranges, lettuce, new onions&mdash;all the delicacies
greatly to be prized and more esteemed after a
long winter than the rarest fruits and dainties of
the States.</p>

<p>When summer came, Dawson got its first shipment
of new watermelons from the outside, Swiftwater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
bought the first melon he could find and paid $40 in
dust for it, and brought it home, simply to please
Bera and to make his home that much happier.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi170">HYDRAULIC mining in the Klondike
country, by the time that Swiftwater
had assembled his big outfit on Quartz
Creek was in its very infancy, yet there
were plenty of wise men in Dawson who
knew that the tens of thousands of
acres of hillside slopes and old abandoned creek
beds would some day produce more gold when
washed into sluice boxes with gigantic rams, than
the native miner and prospector had been able to
show, even with the figures, $50,000,000, output to
his credit.</p>

<p>The Canadian government had given Swiftwater
and his partner, Joe Boyle, a princely fortune
in the three mile concession on Quartz Creek. So
great was the reputation of Swiftwater Bill&mdash;so
intimately was his name linked with the idea of immense
quantities of gold&mdash;and so high was his
standing as a practical miner, that Swiftwater was
able to borrow money right and left to carry on his
work on Quartz Creek. Thus it was that before
anybody could realize it, including myself, Swiftwater’s
financial standing actually was $100,000
worse off than nothing. This was about the amount
of money that he used and in that tidy sum was all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the savings of my winter in Dawson and my dividends
from my hotel, which aggregated at least
$35,000.</p>

<p>“When Joe comes in this spring from London,”
said Swiftwater to me, “we’ll have all the money we
want and more, too, Mrs. Beebe. He has cabled
twice to Seattle that our money is all raised and we
will have a million-dollar clean-up on Quartz Creek
this fall.”</p>

<p>As the spring came on and reports from the
mines on Quartz Creek became brighter, Swiftwater
became more enthusiastic and confident. The fact
that his creditors were beginning to worry, and that
there is a nasty law in Canada which affects debtors
who seek to leave the country in a restraining way,
did not seriously worry Swiftwater. He seemed to
think more of the coming of his child than anything
else, next to the work on Quartz Creek.</p>

<p>“That baby is going to be born on Quartz Creek,
Mrs. B&mdash;” Swiftwater said. “It is my determination
that my first child shall be born where I will
make a greater fortune than anybody hereabouts.”</p>

<p>I told Swiftwater that he was talking arrant nonsense.</p>

<p>“It would be the death of Bera in her condition,”
said I, “for her to take the trip up there in this cold,
nasty weather, with the roads more like swamps
than anything else and the hills still covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
snow. More than that, there are doctors here in
Dawson and on Quartz Creek we would be thirty
miles from the nearest human settlement.”</p>

<p>But nothing would deter Swiftwater. He set
about rigging up a big sled which could be pulled
by two horses. It was made of heavy oaken
timber, and the long low bed was filled with
furs, blankets, bedding, etc. Swiftwater went
to Dr. Marshall, our physician, when all arrangements
had been practically completed for the
journey to Quartz. He had effectually stopped my
protests before he said to Dr. Marshall:</p>

<p>“I will give you $2,000 or more, if necessary, to
take six weeks off and go with me up to Quartz
Creek where my child will be born. Just name your
figure if that is not enough.”</p>

<p>Bera was seventeen years old, immature and delicate,
yet brave and strong, and willing to imperil
her own life to gratify Swiftwater’s whim. So it
finally came about that I was delegated to do the
final shopping in advance of our journey.</p>

<p>I went to Gandolfo’s and bought with my own
money a case of oranges and a crate of apples. Each
orange cost $3 in dust and the apples about the same.
Next I ordered a barrel of bottled beer, for Swiftwater
wanted to treat his men with a feast when the
baby was born and the bottled beer was what he
thought to be the proper thing. The barrel of beer
cost me close to $500 in gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>All this stuff was loaded on the sled. They started
over the twenty-eight miles of crooked, winding,
marshy trail to Quartz Creek. The journey was
something terrible. The days were short and the
wind from the hills and gulches was wet with the
thawing of the snow and so cold that it seemed to
make icicles of the drippings from the trees. Bera,
wrapped a foot thick in furs, seemed to stand the
trip all right, and in due time the baby was born
and christened.</p>

<p>There was great rejoicing in the camp and Swiftwater
weighed out $3,000 in dust to Dr. Marshall
and sent him back to Dawson. A month afterwards
one of our men brought from Dawson the word that
the mail had arrived over the ice, but Swiftwater
looked in vain for a letter from Joe Boyle. He
had confidently expected a draft for $50,000.</p>

<p>For two days Swiftwater scarcely spoke. The
cabin in which we lived was only a quarter of a mile
from the nearest dump where the men were working.
I used to go out every once in a while and take up a
few shovels full of gravel which would wash out between
$5 and $10 and if I had had the good common sense
which comes only after years of hard knocks
in this troublesome world, I could then and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
have protected myself against the bitter misfortunes
which came to me in a few months afterwards.</p>

<p>I was washing some of the baby’s clothes in the
kitchen and drying them on a line over the fire,
when Swiftwater came in from the diggings, clad
in his rubber boots which reached to his hips.</p>

<p>The miner asked for some hot water and a towel
and began to shave the three weeks’ black growth
from his chin.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do now, Swiftwater?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“I’m going down to town.”</p>

<p>For two days the cabin had been without food except
some mush and a few dried potatoes and a can
of condensed milk for the baby. Swiftwater had
sent a man over the trail to Dawson for food two
days before.</p>

<p>“You’ll not go without Bera! You are not going
to leave us here to starve,” said I.</p>

<p>“Bera cannot possibly go,” said Bill.</p>

<p>I turned and went to Bera’s room and told her to
dress immediately. Then I washed the baby, put an
entire new change of clothes on him, wrapped up
his freshly ironed garments in a package, got a bottle
of soothing syrup and a can of condensed milk.</p>

<p>It was always my belief and is now, that Swiftwater’s
mind contained a plan to abandon Bera, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
baby and me, and to run away from the Yukon to
escape his troubles.</p>

<p>We got a small boat and filled one end of it with
fir boughs, covered them over with rugs, and put
Bera and the baby there. Then Swiftwater and I
got in the boat and pushed off down stream.</p>

<p>Swiftwater confessed to me for the first time
that he was in serious trouble.</p>

<p>“There have been three strange men from Dawson
out here on our claims,” said Swiftwater, “and
I know who sent them out. They are watching me.”</p>

<p>As I look back upon that awful trip down Indian
River, with poor, wan, white-faced Bera hugging
the little three weeks’ old baby to her bosom, so
sick that she could hardly talk, I wonder if there
is any hardship, and peril, and privation, and suffering,
a woman cannot endure.</p>

<p>The boat was heavy&mdash;terribly heavy. In the small
stretches of still water it was desperately hard,
bone-racking toil to keep moving.</p>

<p>In the rushes of the river, where rapids tore at
mill-race speed over boulders and pebbly stretches,
we were constantly in danger of being upset. An
hour of this sort of work made me almost ready
for any sort of fate.</p>

<p>Finally we struck a big rock and the current
carried us on a stretch of sandy beach. Swiftwater
and I got out and waded up to our armpits in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
cold stream to get the boat started again. Then
we climbed aboard and once more shot down the
rocky canyon to another stretch of still water beyond.
By nightfall we had reached an old cabin
half way to Dawson, in which the fall before Swiftwater
had cached provisions. The baby’s food was
all gone, and Bera, in a fit of anger, had thrown
what little bread and butter sandwiches we had
put up for ourselves, overboard. I had not eaten
all day, nor had Swiftwater.</p>

<p>It was growing dusk when we painfully pulled
the boat on the bank at Swiftwater’s cache. Gates
went inside to get some grub and prepared to build
a fire. He came out a moment later, his face ashy
pale, his eyes downcast.</p>

<p>“They have stolen all I had put in here,” he said.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that night as if the very limit of
human misery on this earth was my bitter portion
as we waited all through the weary hours in the
cabin huddled before a little fire, waiting (it is light
all the time in summer) to resume our journey to
Dawson.</p>

<p>The next day we reached Dawson shortly after
noon, famished, cold, and completely exhausted. I
actually believe the baby would have died but for
the bottle of soothing syrup and water which I had
brought along.</p>

<p>Swiftwater took us to the Fairview Hotel and sent
for the doctor for Bera and the baby.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi">TO THE people of Dawson, in those days,
starving through weary winter
months for want of frequent mail communication
with the civilized world,
and hungering for the ebb and flow of
human tide that is a natural and daily part of the
lives of those in more fortunate places, the arrival
of the first steamer from “the outside” in the spring
is an event even greater than a Fourth of July celebration
to a country town in Kansas.</p>

<p>For days before our arrival down Indian River
from Quartz Creek, the men and women of Dawson
had eagerly discussed the probability of the coming
of the Yukoner, the regular river liner from
White Horse due any moment, with fresh provisions
from Seattle and the first papers and letters
from “the outside.”</p>

<p>For two days after Swiftwater had taken Bera to
the Fairview Hotel, the doctor had cared for her so
as to enable her to recover from the hardships of
the trip down Indian River. I took the baby to my
own rooms and carefully nursed him through all one
day. This brought him quickly round, and he soon
looked as bright and cheerful as a new twenty
dollar gold piece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>It was on the third morning after we arrived in
Dawson that the steamer Yukoner’s whistle sounded
up the river, and the whole populace rushed to
the wharves and river banks. Miners came from all
points up the creeks to welcome friends or to get
their mail that the Yukoner had brought. The little
shopkeepers in Dawson, particularly the fruit venders,
were extremely active, bustling amongst the
crowd on the dock and fighting their way to get
the first shipments of early vegetables, fruits, fresh
eggs, fresh butter and other perishable commodities
for which Dawson hungered.</p>

<p>But Swiftwater, keen eyed, nervous, straining,
yet trying to be composed, saw none of this, nor
felt the least interest in the tide of newcomers who
stepped from the Yukoner’s decks and made their
way up town surrounded by friends.</p>

<p>Swiftwater was looking for one face in the crowd&mdash;that
of his partner, Joe Boyle, who had promised
to bring him $100,000 from London, where the
big concession on Quartz Creek had been bonded for
$250,000.</p>

<p>Swiftwater stood at the gang plank and eagerly
scanned every face until the last man had come
ashore and only the deck hands remained on board.</p>

<p>“There is certainly a letter in the mail, anyhow,”
said Swiftwater.</p>

<p>For the first time in all of this miserable experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
I realized that a heavy burden was on Swiftwater’s
shoulders&mdash;a load that was crushing the
heart and brain of him&mdash;and that would, unless relieved,
destroy all of the man’s native capacity to
handle his tangled affairs, even under the most unfavorable
circumstances.</p>

<p>I decided to watch Swiftwater very closely. I
noticed that he was not to be seen around town in
his usual haunts. I did not dare ask him if he
feared arrest, for that would show that I knew
that his crisis had come.</p>

<p>Two hours after the Yukoner’s mail was in the
postoffice, Swiftwater came to my room.</p>

<p>“There is no letter from Joe,” was all he said.</p>

<p>I made no reply except to say:</p>

<p>“Have you told Bera?”</p>

<p>“No, and I’m not going to&mdash;now,” said Swiftwater
and then left the room.</p>

<p>Swiftwater had between $35,000 and $40,000 of
my money in his Quartz Creek concession. I had
felt absolutely secure for the reason that if the property
was well handled my interest should be worth
from $100,000 to $250,000. My faith in the property
has been justified by subsequent events, as all well
informed Dawson mining men will testify.</p>

<p>But the want of money was bitter and keen at
that moment. Yet I scarcely knew what to advise
Swiftwater to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Gates and Bera came to my rooms after dinner
that night.</p>

<p>“Will this help you pay a few pressing little
bills?” asked Swiftwater, as he threw two fifty
dollar paper notes in my lap.</p>

<p>“My God, Swiftwater, can’t you spare any more
than $100?” I gasped.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s just for now&mdash;I’ll give you plenty
more tomorrow,” said he.</p>

<p>As they arose to go, Bera kissed me on the mouth
and cheek with her arms around my neck.</p>

<p>“You love the baby, don’t you mama?” said
Bera, and I saw then, without seeing, and came
afterwards to know that there were tears in Bera’s
eyes and a smile dewy with affection on her lips.</p>

<p>Swiftwater put his arm around me and kissed me
on the forehead.</p>

<p>“We’ll be over early for you for breakfast tomorrow,”
said Swiftwater as they went down the
stairs.</p>

<p>Holding the baby in my arms at the window, I
watched Swiftwater and Bera go down the street,
Bera turning now and again to wave her hand and
throw a kiss to me, Swiftwater lifting his hat.</p>

<p>Now, what I am about to relate may seem almost
incredible to any normal human mind and heart;
and especially so to those thousands of Alaskans
who knew Swiftwater in the early days to be jolly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
though impractical, yet always generous, whole-souled,
brave and honest.</p>

<p>An hour after Swiftwater and Bera had gone,
there was a knock at my door. I opened it and there
stood Phil Wilson&mdash;an old associate and friend
of Swiftwater’s.</p>

<p>“Is Bill Gates here?” asked Wilson.</p>

<p>“Why, no,” said I. “They went over an hour
ago.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said he, and lumbered heavily
down the stairs.</p>

<p>The next morning I waited until 11 o’clock for
Swiftwater and Bera to come for me to go to
breakfast. I had slept little or none the night
before and my nerves were worn down to the fine
edge that comes just before a total collapse.</p>

<p>When it seemed as if I could not wait longer,
there came a knock at the door.</p>

<p>When I opened the door there stood George
Taylor, a friend of Swiftwater’s of some years’
standing.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Beebe, I came to tell you that Swiftwater
and Bera left early this morning to go to Quartz
Creek on horseback. I promised Swiftwater I would
help you move to his cabin and get everything ready
for their return on Saturday.”</p>

<p>“In Heaven’s name, what is Swiftwater trying
to do&mdash;kill Bera?” I exclaimed. “That ride to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Quartz Creek in her condition, through the mud
and mire of that trail, will kill her.”</p>

<p>Taylor merely looked at me and did not answer.</p>

<p>“Are you telling me the truth?” I demanded.</p>

<p>“I am,” he said.</p>

<p>Taylor walked away and I closed the door and
went back to the baby.</p>

<p>“Baby,” said I, “I guess we’re left all alone for
a while and you haven’t any mama but me.”</p>

<p>Although I afterward learned of the fact, it did
me no good at that trying moment that Swiftwater
had told Bera, before she would consent to leave
me, that he had sent me $800 in currency by Wilson.
Of course, Swiftwater did nothing of the kind, yet
his story was such as to lead Bera to believe that I
was well protected and comfortable.</p>

<p>Then I set to work to move my little belongings
into Swiftwater’s cabin, there to wait for four days
hoping that every minute would bring some word
from Bera and Gates. There was little to
eat in the cabin and the $100 that Swiftwater had
given me had nearly all gone for baby’s necessities.
The little fellow had kept up well and strong in
spite of everything, and when I undressed him at
night and bathed him and got him ready for his
bed, he seemed so brave and strong and sweet that
I could not, for the life of me, give way to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
feeling of desolation and loss that my circumstances
warranted.</p>

<p>On the third day after Bera and Swiftwater had
gone and I was getting a little supper for the baby
and myself in the cabin, there came a clatter of
heavy boots on the gravel walk in front of the
house and a boisterous knock on the door.</p>

<p>Jumping up from the kitchen table, I nearly ran
to the door, believing that Bera and Swiftwater
were there. Instead there stood a messenger from
the McDonald Hotel in Dawson with a letter for me.
It simply said:</p>


<p class="p1">“We have gone down the river in a small boat
to Nome with Mr. Wilson. I will send you money
immediately on arrival there, so that you can join
us.</p>

<p class="pr4">SWIFTWATER.”</p>

<p class="p1">That was all.</p>

<p>I read the letter through again and then the
horror of it came over me&mdash;I all alone in Dawson
with Swiftwater’s four weeks’ old baby, broke and
he owing me nearly $40,000.</p>

<p>Then everything seemed to leave me and I fell
to the floor unconscious. Hours afterward&mdash;they
said it was 9 o’clock at night, and the messenger
had been there at 4 in the afternoon&mdash;I came to.
The baby was crying and hungry. It seemed to
me I had been in a long sickness and I could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
for a while quite realize where I was or what ill
shape of a hostile fate had befallen me. And, when
I think of it now, it seems to me any other woman in
my place would have gone crazy.</p>

<p>For two months I stayed in that cabin, trying
my best to find a way out of Dawson and unable to
move a rod because of the fact that I had no money.
Swiftwater, as I learned afterwards, took a lay on
a claim on Dexter Creek and cleaned up in a short
time $4,000.</p>

<p>When I heard this, I wrote to him for money for
the baby, but none came.</p>

<p>A month passed and then another and no word
from Swiftwater. I felt as long as I had a roof
over my head, I could make a living for myself and
the baby by working at anything&mdash;manicuring, hairdressing
or sewing. Then, one evening, just after
I had finished dinner, came a rap at the door.</p>

<p>It was Phil Wilson.</p>

<p>“Swiftwater has given me a deed to this house
and power of attorney over his other matters,”
said he. “I shall move my things over here and
occupy one of these three rooms.”</p>

<p>I knew better than to make any objection then,
but the next day I told Wilson:</p>

<p>“You will have to take your things down town&mdash;you
cannot stay here.”</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll stay all right, Mrs. Beebe,” said he.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
“And it will be all winter, too. And, I think it
would be better for you, Mrs. Beebe, if you stayed
here with me.”</p>

<p>I knew just what that meant. I said:</p>

<p>“Mr. Wilson, I understand you, but you will go
and take your things now.”</p>

<p>Wilson left in another minute and I did not see
him for two days. On the second afternoon I locked
the door with a padlock and went down town to do
some shopping for the baby, who I had left with a
neighbor. I also wanted to send a fourth letter to
Swiftwater, begging him to send me some money
to keep me and his baby from starving.</p>

<p>When I got back at dusk that evening, the door
to the cabin was broken open, and the chain and
padlock lay on the ground shattered into fragments.</p>

<p>I went inside. All my clothes, the baby’s and
even the little personal belongings of the child were
piled together in a disordered heap in the center
room.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dci09_17.jpg" width="80" height="139" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi125">IT WAS pitch dark when I left the cabin and
made my way directly, as best I could, to
the town with its dimly lighted streets. It
seemed to me that I had never had a friend
in all this world. Friend? Yes, FRIEND. That
is to say&mdash;a human being who could be depended
upon in any emergency and who was right&mdash;right
all the time in fair as well as in foul weather.</p>

<p>There was only one thought in my mind&mdash;that
was to find some man or woman in all that country
to whom I could go for shelter and for aid. I knew
naught of Swiftwater and Bera, except that they
had left me. Swiftwater’s child, I felt as if he
was my own&mdash;that little babe smiling up into my
face as I had held him in my arms but a few minutes
before, seemed to me as if he was my own.</p>

<p>I knew instinctively that there was none in all
that multitude of carefree or careworn miners who
thronged the three cafes and the dance halls of Dawson
who could do much, if anything, to help me.</p>

<p>Past the dance halls and saloons and gambling
halls of Dawson I went my way, down beyond the
town and finally found the dark trail that led to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the barracks of the mounted police. I told the captain
exactly what had happened. I said:</p>

<p>“Captain, I am left all alone here by Swiftwater
Bill and I have to find some place to shelter his
little two months’ old child and to feed and
clothe him. He told me to live in his cabin. But
I have no home there now as long as that man Wilson
lives there.”</p>

<p>No woman who has never known the hard and
seamy side of life in Dawson can possibly understand
how good are the mounted police to every
human being, man, woman or child, who is in
trouble without fault of their own. The captain
said.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Beebe, I have long known of you, and I
do not doubt that a wrong has been done you.
You and your little grandson shall not suffer for
want of shelter or food tonight.”</p>

<p>With that the captain detailed two officers with
instructions to accompany me to Swiftwater’s cabin
and to see that I was comfortably and safely housed
there, no matter what the circumstances. We went
back that long, dark way, a mile over the trail to
the cabin. When we arrived there, the two officers
went inside.</p>

<p>“Place this woman’s clothes and belongings
where they were before you came in here, and do
it at once,” commanded one of the mounted police.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Wilson looked at me in amazement, and then his
face was flushed with an angry glow as he saw that
the two officers meant business.</p>

<p>Without a word, he picked up all the baby’s
clothes and my own and put them back where they
had been before. Then he took his pack of clothes
and belongings and left without a word.</p>

<p>It would merely encumber my story to tell how
I was summoned into court by Phil Wilson, and
how the judge, after hearing my story of Swiftwater’s
brutality&mdash;of his leaving me in Dawson
penniless with his baby&mdash;said that he could hardly
conceive how a man could be so inhuman as Swiftwater
was, to leave the unprotected mother of his
wife and his baby alone in such a place as Dawson
and in such hands as those of the man who stood
before him. He said that such brutality, in his
judgment, was without parallel in Dawson’s annals
and that, while he felt the deepest sympathy for me,
left as I had been helpless and with Swiftwater’s
baby, yet the law gave Phil Wilson the right to
the cabin.</p>

<p>This ended the case. I turned to go from the
courtroom when the Presbyterian minister, Dr. McKenzie,
came to me and said:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Beebe, I do not know anything about the
circumstances that have brought you to this condition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
but if you will let me have the child I will
see that he has a good home and is well cared for.”</p>

<p>But this was not necessary, as it turned out afterwards,
because Dr. McKenzie took the matter up
with the council, where it was threshed out in all
its details. The council voted $125 a month for
sustenance for the nurse and the baby. The mounted
police took me to the barracks and there provided
a cabin and food, with regular supplies of provisions
from the canteen.</p>

<p>I do not doubt but that the monthly expense
during the winter that I lived there with the baby
is still a matter of record in Dawson in the archives
of the government, and I am equally certain that,
although Swiftwater Bill has made hundreds of
thousands of dollars since that day and is now reputed
to be worth close to $1,000,000, he has never
liquidated the debt he owes to the Canadian government
for the care and sustenance and shelter they
gave his own boy. All of the facts stated in this
chapter can easily be verified by recourse to the
records of the court and mounted police in Dawson.</p>

<p>Although I knew that Swiftwater was making
money in Nome, I placed no more dependence in
him from that moment and managed to sustain
myself by manicuring and hairdressing in Dawson.</p>

<p>The winter wore away, and there was the usual
annual celebration of the coming of spring with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
its steamers from White Horse laden with the first
papers and the mail from the outside. In May of
that year I received a telegram from Swiftwater
Bill telling me to leave Dawson on the first boat
and come down the river to Nome, as he and Bera
would be there on the first boat from Seattle. The
day after I received the telegram the mail came
and brought a letter written by Swiftwater from
Chicago, saying that he had the money to pay me
all he owed me and more too, and for me not to
fail to meet him and Bera in Nome.</p>

<p>Isn’t it curious how a woman will forget all the
injustice she suffers at the hands of a man, when
it seems to her that he is trying to do and is doing
the right thing?</p>

<p>Does it seem odd to you, my woman reader, that
the thought of meeting Bera again and of giving
to her and to Swiftwater the custody of the dear
little child I had loved and nursed all winter long,
should have appealed to me?</p>

<p>And now, as there must be an end to the hardest
luck story&mdash;just as there is a finish at some time
to all forms of human grief and sorrow&mdash;so there
came an end to that winter in the little cabin near
the mounted police barracks at Dawson, where baby
and I and the nurse, Lena Hubbell, had spent so
many weeks waiting for a change in our luck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Again there was a mob of every kind of people
in Dawson.</p>

<p>On the first steamer leaving Dawson I went with
the child, after giving up a good business that
netted me between $200 and $300 a month. I took
the nurse girl with me&mdash;who had been in unfortunate
circumstances in Dawson&mdash;and I speak of her
now, as she figures prominently in another chapter
in this book.</p>

<p>It matters little now that Swiftwater could have
provided handsomely for me and the child&mdash;that he
took the money that he made from his lay on Dexter
Creek and spent it gambling at Nome; and that
Bera, knowing my circumstances, took from a sluice
box on his claim enough gold to exchange for $500
in bills at Nome, to send to me.</p>

<p>And when I think of this my blood boils, for
Bera, after she had the $500 in bills wrapped in a
piece of paper and sealed up in an envelope addressed
to me, met Swiftwater on the street in
Nome and he took the money away from her,
saying:</p>

<p>“Bera, I’ll mail that letter to your mother.”</p>

<p>Of course, I never got the money because Swiftwater
gambled it away, and I laying awake nights
crying and unable to sleep because of my worry,
and working hard throughout the long winter days
to support Swiftwater’s child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>So it came about that we boarded the big river
steamer Susie for Nome. Her decks were jammed
with people eager to get outside or anxious to try
their fortunes in the new Seward Peninsula gold
fields or the beach diggings at Nome. The Yukon
was clear of ice, wide, deep and beautiful to look
upon in summer, though in winter, when the ice is
packed up one hundred feet high, it carries the
death dealing blizzards that bring an untimely fate
to many a hardy traveler.</p>

<p>In Nome I found no further news of Swiftwater
nor Bera and waited there for three weeks. Then,
after days of watching at the postoffice, I got a
letter from Swiftwater, saying that it would not be
possible for him to come to Nome, and there was
not even so much as a dollar bill in the letter.</p>

<p>Disheartened and miserable, I turned to go back
to my hotel. As I turned from the postoffice a news-boy
rushed up from the wharf, crying out:</p>

<p>“SEATTLE TIMES&mdash;ALL ABOUT SWIFTWATER
BILL RUNNING AWAY WITH ANOTHER
WOMAN.”</p>

<p class="drop-capi170">AS I write this chapter, which is to interest
not only the friends and acquaintances of
Swiftwater Bill, but which also may throw
a new light on his character, and may
even arouse a general interest in the odd
freaks of human nature which one finds
in the northern country, I am moved to wonder
whether or not there is a human pen capable of portraying
all of the many-sided phases of Swiftwater’s
nature. The story in the Seattle paper merely gave
an outline of Swiftwater’s escapade, when he ran
away with Kitty Brandon, took her from Portland
to Seattle and back to Chehalis and there married
her on June 20th, 1901.</p>

<p>If Swiftwater Bill’s title as the Don Juan of
the Klondike had ever been questioned before this
affair, it seems to me that his elopement with Kitty
Brandon from Portland early in June of that year
would have forever settled the matter in his favor.
The Seattle paper merely told that Swiftwater and
Kitty had been married, against the will and wish
of her mother at Chehalis, and that the girl’s mother
learning of the affair had followed the lovers to
Seattle.</p>

<p>Kitty was a fragile, neatly formed girl of fifteen
years, when she went to St. Helen’s Hall in Portland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
as a student. Swiftwater left Bera in the spring
of that year at Washington, D. C., and hurried
across the continent, intending, as he told me in all
his letters, on making another fortune in Alaska.
He had valuable interests in the gold mining district
near Teller, Alaska, and in his fond imagination
there was every reason to believe that the Kougarok
country was as rich, if not richer, than Eldorado
and Bonanza in the Klondike.</p>

<p>“Bring my baby down to Nome and meet me
at Teller,” Swiftwater wrote me. “I am so glad
you have taken such good care of my darling son
all winter in Dawson. I shall pay you all that
you have loaned me and I will see that you make
more money in Teller City than you ever made in
Dawson. I could hug and kiss you for taking such
good care of our baby boy.”</p>

<p>Such was the language of Swiftwater’s letters to
me, written in Washington in the spring of that
year. Swiftwater reasoned that all of Alaska is
underlaid with gold; that the fabulous riches of
Eldorado and Bonanza would be duplicated again
and again on Seward peninsula. To his mind, the
making of a fortune of a million of dollars in a
summer in the new diggings near Teller was one
of the simplest things in the world, and it is not to
be wondered at that there were hundreds among
his friends who believed then and do now that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
mining judgment and fairy-like luck were such as
to enable him to go forth into the north at any
time and bring out hundreds of thousands of dollars
in the precious yellow stuff.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, when Swiftwater reached the
coast, he happened by ill chance to stop at Portland.
In St. Helen’s Hall there was Kitty Brandon,
known as his niece, a girl of more than ordinary
mental and physical charms. Once again the amorous
nature of Swiftwater Bill asserted itself. It
is related that he called at St. Helen’s Hall and
interviewed Kitty Brandon, and then after that was
a frequent visitor, taking Kitty at odd times driving
through the beautiful city of Portland or entertaining
her at lunch or dinner, as the case might be, in
Portland’s swell cafes.</p>

<p>That Swiftwater had no plans for his immediate
future can well be believed when it is known that
after a few days of courtship of Kitty Brandon,
he eloped with the little girl and came to Seattle.
On the way to Seattle Kitty and Swiftwater were
married at Chehalis.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that Swiftwater found his
last love affair anything but a summer holiday,
when it is remembered that his legal wife, Bera, was
in Washington, D. C., awaiting his return. Considerations
of propriety and, even of the law, seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to have left Swiftwater’s mind entirely, until Kitty’s
mother learned of his elopement and followed the
loving pair to Seattle.</p>

<p>What followed afterwards was told in the Seattle,
Tacoma and Portland newspapers of that time.
Learning that Swiftwater and Kitty were registered
as man and wife at a Seattle hotel, Kitty’s mother
followed them and sought to apprehend them. Then
it was that Swiftwater evinced that capacity for resource
and tact which, as all his friends know, is
one of his most distinguished characteristics.</p>

<p>With the irate mother of his newest love lying
in wait at night in the lobby of one of Seattle’s
best known hotels, it was Swiftwater’s task to show
that skill in maneuver and celerity in action which
tens of thousands of Northerners attributed to him
as the origin of his odd nickname. There was no
time to repent for his infatuation for the pretty
Kitty Brandon, or to remember the fate of his deserted
wife and child in Washington.</p>

<p>And Swiftwater was equal to the emergency.
Bidding Kitty’s mother wait in the hotel parlor,
Swiftwater rushed to his room, telephoned for a
hack to come to the rear of the hostelry, and in less
than ten minutes Bill and his sweetheart were being
driven at breakneck speed through the streets of
Seattle, southward over the bridge across the tide
flats, headed for Tacoma. It was told by Swiftwater
afterwards that in nearly every mile of that trip
fear that Kitty’s mother was pursuing him and his
inamorita followed him and for the greater part of
the way he kept watching down the dark road in the
rear of his hack, expecting that at every turn of
the road the wrathful parent would be in sight in
readiness to pounce upon him.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi170">AS I look back on that day in Nome and recall
the sensation created in the little mining
camp when the paper containing the
story of Swiftwater’s perfidy was circulated
abroad among the people, I am tempted
to wonder if the duplicate or parallel of
Swiftwater’s enormities at this time can be found
in all the annals of this great Northwestern country.
The Times’ story seemed, even to those like
myself, who knew something of Swiftwater’s character,
to be almost incredible, and for my part it
was several hours before I realized, in a dumb unfeeling
sort of a way, that Swiftwater had absolutely
stolen his own sister’s child&mdash;Kitty Brandon&mdash;a
girl not more than sixteen years old, had eloped
with her, committed bigamy by marrying her in
Chehalis, Wash., and at the same time had deserted
his wife and left her penniless in Washington, D. C.</p>

<p>It was long after nightfall as I sat in my room,
the baby sound asleep in his little crib, the nurse
gone for the night, and I had read The Times’
story about Swiftwater and Kitty over the twentieth
time, that I felt the real force of the shame and
scandal which the miner had placed about himself
and Bera, and which did not even leave me and my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
little grandson, Clifford, outside of its dark and
forbidding pall.</p>

<p>All that night I lay awake and wondered how in
Heaven’s name I could get word to Bera&mdash;or if she
had received a telegram from friends in Seattle
and the blow had killed her&mdash;or whether she was
then on her way West, or whatever fate had befallen
her.</p>

<p>I knew little about Swiftwater’s business affairs
just at that time except that he had gone to Washington
in the hope of furthering his mining ventures
in the North and had taken Bera with him. Then
I remembered that in his letters to me and telegrams
urging me to join him at Nome he had
spoken about having raised considerable money and
was able to pay his debt to me and lift me out of
the mire of toil and drudgery in Alaska, in which
I had sojourned for so many months.</p>

<p>All that night I neither slept nor rested. It
seemed to me at times as if my head would split
into a thousand pieces with the thought of Swiftwater’s
treachery to Bera and myself. Then I
realized the utter futility and helplessness of a
woman situated as I was in Nome, absolutely unable
to get a telegram or quick letter to Bera or to
hear from her telling me of her condition. For
aught I knew, she might have been deathly sick,
cared for only by strangers or left destitute at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
some place in the East and without any means
whatever of righting herself.</p>

<p>It seems to me, now when I think of that all
night’s vigil in the little hotel in Nome, that Providence
must have been watching over me, that I did
not lose my reason. At last I found that unless I
went to work doing something, I would sure go
crazy, and then I started to get work, first borrowing
some money, which I sent out by mail the next
day to Bera at her last address.</p>

<p>While I worked and slaved in Nome trying to
get a few dollars ahead so that I could care for
the baby and make my way out to Seattle to help
Bera, I finally got word that she had been left
destitute in Washington, D. C. Swiftwater had
furnished four nice rooms in an apartment house
at Washington, and in their effects was more than
$1,000 worth of rare curios and ivory from
Alaska. Then came another letter that Bera, unable
to pay for her care, food and medical attention&mdash;the
second baby boy was born August 28th&mdash;had
been put on board a train with a charity ticket,
her ivories and curios sold for a trifle and had
been started West for Seattle.</p>

<p>I need not dwell on how Bera, more dead than
alive from five days traveling in a chair car from
Washington to Seattle with her babe at her bosom
and unable to sleep at all&mdash;with nothing to eat but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
a few sandwiches which they had given her at
Washington&mdash;arrived in Seattle and was cared for
by friends.</p>

<p>They took the girl, so weak she could hardly
stand on her feet, to a restaurant and gave her her
first hot meal in almost a week. Then Bera and her
baby went to Portland to live with her grandma,
while Swiftwater and Kitty Gates were touring
the country.</p>

<p>And do you know that Swiftwater’s polygamous
wife, Kitty Gates, was the girl who Bera one year
before had fitted out with a nice outfit of clothes
and had sent her to a convent school at Portland to
be given a good education?</p>

<p>Yes, this is the truth, and this was Kitty’s gratitude
to Bera and Swiftwater’s crime against the
law and his own flesh and blood.</p>

<p>How we managed after I came to Seattle from
Nome to live in a little room in a small old fashioned
house on Fourth Avenue with barely enough
to eat and scarcely enough clothes to cover ourselves
need not be told here in detail. I sometimes
wonder whether or not I have overladen my little
narrative with grief and misery and crime against
humanity and against human laws, as well as God’s.
And then I wonder still more why it was that there
were men in Seattle, in San Francisco and in Fairbanks
in those days who were always ready to exalt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Swiftwater and do him honor and take him by the
hand, while the world would look askance at Bera
Gates, his wife, whom he had so grieviously
wronged.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">SWIFTWATER BILL GATES is back.”</p>

<p>One morning in Seattle months
after Bera and I had set up a little
housekeeping establishment in Seattle,
I picked up the Saturday evening
edition of The Times and almost
dropped over in my chair when I saw headlines in
the paper as shown in the foregoing.</p>

<p>What had been Swiftwater Bill’s fortune in all
those months, I knew not, but the fact as stated in
the paper that he had returned from Alaska was
sufficient for me.</p>

<p>Bera said: “Mama, I don’t know any reason why
you should fuss around about Swiftwater.”</p>

<p>“Never mind me,” said I, “I’ll find him, my
dear, just to see what he has to say for himself.”</p>

<p>Down to the Hotel Northern, then the Butler,
the Rainier-Grand and the Stevens and all the rest
I went and searched the registers without avail. As
I remember now, it took me the greater part of a
day to cover all the ground.</p>

<p>Finally, by a curious chance I located Swiftwater
at the Victoria Hotel. I waited until the next
morning and then went to the Victoria and asked
for Gates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Swiftwater, the clerk said, was out&mdash;had not been
seen but once since his arrival.</p>

<p>I am not going to say whether or not it was the
humor of the situation or the bitter resentment I
bore toward him that led me to tramp up three
flights of stairs to the little parlor on the landing
close to Swiftwater’s room, and to wait there ten
hours at a stretch&mdash;until 1:10 in the morning. Then
I went home, only to return at 8 o’clock the next
day.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gates is in his room, but he is asleep,”
said the clerk.</p>

<p>“I am Mrs. Beebe, his mother-in-law, and I want
to see him now and I shall go direct to his room.
You can go with me if you desire,” said I. The
little clerk scanned me carefully and then said,
“Very well.” We went upstairs together.</p>

<p>The clerk rapped on the door twice. There was
no answer.</p>

<p>“I guess he’s out,” said the boy.</p>

<p>“Knock again&mdash;good and loud,” I commanded.</p>

<p>The boy rapped and just then the door opened a
tiny way&mdash;about an inch, I guess, but through that
little crack I saw the eye and part of the curling
black moustache of Swiftwater Bill.</p>

<p>Then I threw myself against the door and walked
in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">“COME OUT OF THAT, BILL! I HAVEN’T GOT A GUN.”</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>I wish I could tell you how funny was Swiftwater’s
apparition, as, clad only in his white night
robe, he jumped into bed, pulling the covers over
his head.</p>

<p>This was the first time that Swiftwater had seen
me since he left me in Dawson alone and unprotected,
to find means as best I could to provide
shelter and sustenance for his little baby boy, Clifford.</p>

<p>In spite of myself, I laughed, forgetting all of the
long months that we had waited for some sign of
Swiftwater and an indication of his desire to do
what was right by his own two little babies.</p>

<p>“Coward,” I said, still laughing. “You know
you deserve to be shot.”</p>

<p>No answer from Swiftwater, whose body was completely
covered up by bed clothes.</p>

<p>Now, most men and most women will admire a
MAN, but a cur and a coward are universally
despised.</p>

<p>As I looked at that huddled up mass of humanity
underneath the white bedspread, my heart rose in
rage. The contempt I felt for him is beyond all
expression.</p>

<p>“Come out of that, Bill,” said I. “I have no
gun!”</p>

<p>After a while, Swiftwater poked his head from beneath
the bed clothes and showed a blanched face
covered with a three weeks’ old growth of black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
beard. I told him to dress and I would wait outside.
In a few minutes Swiftwater emerged and
there stood a man who had commanded hundreds of
thousands of dollars in money and gold in Alaska,
looking just exactly as if he had dropped from the
brake-beam of a Northern Pacific freight train and
had walked his way into Seattle. He was clad in
a dirty sack coat, that shone like a mirror, with
brown striped trousers, an old brown derby hat
and shoes that were out at the sole and side.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Beebe,” said Swiftwater in a trembling
voice, “I am all in. If you will not have me arrested,
but will give me a chance, I’ll soon provide
for the babies and Bera.”</p>

<p>Swiftwater pleaded as if for his life. He said
that he could get money in San Francisco from a
man who had offered to back him in a new scheme
in the Tanana country.</p>

<p>There was I with the two little boys and Bera
all on my hands. I told Swiftwater that I would do
nothing for him, but that I would forego having
him put behind steel bars until I had made up my
mind just what course I should take.</p>

<p>The next night, there was a knock at our door
about 3 o’clock in the morning. Bera slept in the
front room of our little two-room apartment and I
in the other with the babies. I went to the door&mdash;there
stood Swiftwater.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mrs. Beebe,” he said, “I have no place to sleep
tonight. If you will let me lie down on the floor,
so that I can get a little sleep, I will get up early
tomorrow morning and not bother you.”</p>

<p>I told Bera to come into my room and I let
Swiftwater into the kitchen, where I gave him a
comforter on which to lie. The next morning, after
Bera had gone, I prepared Swiftwater’s breakfast.
The man was in rags, almost. I made him take a bath,
while I washed his underclothes, and then I went
out and bought him a new pair of socks and gave
him money with which to buy a new hat.</p>

<p>The next day Swiftwater went to San Francisco
on money I furnished him after I had pawned my
diamonds with one of the best jewelry houses in
Seattle.</p>

<p>Why? Well, because Swiftwater had made me
believe that he had another chance in the Tanana
and that his friends in San Francisco, having faith
in his judgment as a miner&mdash;whatever may be said
of Swiftwater, he was known throughout the North
as an expert miner&mdash;had raised a large sum with
which to grubstake him.</p>

<p>I will say this for Swiftwater: that he gave me
a contract providing that he should pay what he
owed me and give me an interest in such mines as
he would locate in the Tanana country. And then
he went away.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi">SOMETIMES, when I recall the stirring
events in Swiftwater Bill’s career,
following the time he used the money
I raised by pawning my diamonds
and then went to California, I am
tempted to wonder whether or not a
man of his type of mental makeup ever realized
that the hard bumps that he gets along the corduroy
road of adversity are one and all of his own making.
For, if one will but pause a moment and analyze
the events in Swiftwater Bill’s melodramatic career,
the inevitable result comes to him, namely, that
the bumps over which Swiftwater traveled during
all of those years, when, one day he was worth a
half million dollars in gold, and the next was hiding
in all manner of dark and subterranean recesses
in order to avoid deputy sheriffs and constables
with writs and court processes, were placed there
by his own hands and as skilfully and effectively as
if he had deliberately planned to cause himself
misery.</p>

<p>Swiftwater’s transformation from a broken down
tramp of the Weary Willie order to a fine gentleman
and prosperous business man, with new tailor
made clothes, patent leather shoes and his favored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
silk tile, was rapid after he got his hands on the
money I borrowed from the jewelers, with my diamonds
as the pledge. The change in Swiftwater
was simply marvelous. The day before almost,
Swiftwater had stood before me, as I have told,
without collar or tie, a dirty black growth of beard
nearly an inch long on his unshaven chin and cheek,
a dark frock coat of a nondescript shape that had
seen better days and hung on Bill’s frame as though
it might have been loaned to him by some friend;
a pair of trousers of mediocre workmanship and
his feet almost sticking out of his shoes.</p>

<p>Then picture Swiftwater ready to board the
steamer for San Francisco, where his friend Marks
was waiting to grubstake him to the tune of $18,000,
jauntily wearing his polished beaver on the side
of his head, his black moustaches curled and waving
in the breezes, his chin as smooth and immaculate
as an ivory billiard ball and his air and manner
that of a man who had absolute confidence in himself
and his future.</p>

<p>It is no wonder then, that when Swiftwater
reached San Francisco outfitted as I have described,
he found plenty of men, who, charmed by the
magic of his description of the golden lure of the
North and hypnotized into a state of enthusiasm by
the halo of romance and river beds lined with gold
attached to Swiftwater’s name, were willing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
back him heavily for another venture in the North.</p>

<p>By this time the Tanana District was becoming
famous throughout the world and the town of Fairbanks
had been located and Cleary had brought
forth from the stream that bears his name thousands
of dollars of virgin gold, thus proving beyond
question the richness of the country.</p>

<p>Now, I am ready to believe that most people will
agree with me that Swiftwater was about as rapid
and agile a performer as any of his contemporaries
who occupy the hall of fame in the annals of
Alaska. Because it was only a few short weeks
until Swiftwater returns to Seattle with his pockets
bulging with currency and prepared to leave for
Fairbanks.</p>

<p>Of course, I knew nothing of Swiftwater’s presence
in Seattle, though it had been only a few
short weeks since I had, with my own hands, in
the kitchen in the little two-room apartment we
occupied, washed his only suit of underclothes, so
that he could go on the street without being annoyed
by the police.</p>

<p>The first I knew of Swiftwater’s return from San
Francisco was when I read in the morning paper
that “W. C. Gates, the well known and opulent
Alaska miner,” had entertained a distinguished
party of Seattle business men at a banquet at one
of the big down town hotels. The cost of that feed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
as I afterwards learned, was about $100&mdash;of Mr.
Marks’ money. Be that as it may, before I could
find Swiftwater and gently recall to him the fact
that his wife and two little children were almost
in absolute want in Seattle he had managed to
board a steamer for the Tanana and was off for the
North.</p>

<p>Now, when I found that Swiftwater had gone, I
was frantic with the desire to follow him up to
Alaska. For the year and a half that I had remained
in Seattle, waiting like Micawber for something to
turn up, the fever to get back to Alaska seemed to
be growing in my veins at a rate that meant that
something had to be done. For, after Alaska has
once laid her spell over a man or woman, in nine
times out of ten, she will claim him or her from
that time onward to the end of life as her devoted
and always loyal slave. I know not, nor have I
ever found any who did know, what it is that
makes one who has ever lived in Alaska, and
who has left there, unhappy and discontented until
they go back once more to the land of gold.</p>

<p>I have seen and talked with old “sourdoughs,”
trappers and dog team freighters, and they all tell
the same story. When the first big clean-up had
been made in Dawson, I remember well, the winter
following found a mob of big, boisterous, pleasure
loving, money spending, carefree and happy hearted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Klondike miners in the hotels of Seattle, San Francisco
and New York. They lived on nothing but
the choicest steaks and the richest wines, and the
sight of a plate of beans would start a fight. Then
they would all come back to Seattle in the spring,
sick, feverish, unhappy, with a look in their eyes
like that of a mother hungering for her lost babe.
In Seattle they would spend a restless week, but
when they struck the trail at White Horse just
before the spring breakup in the Yukon every man
jack of them was himself again&mdash;jolly, joyous, carefree,
full voiced and filled with the enthusiasm of
a two-year-old.</p>

<p>Why, I have known more than one broad shouldered
giant of the trail grow as sick and puny as a
singed kitten while waiting in Seattle for his boat
to take him, late in February or early in March, to
Skagway. I knew one miner, who in health was
six feet five inches tall, weighing two hundred and
forty pounds without an ounce of fat on him, come
within an ace of dying with quick consumption,
which it afterwards proved was due to his longing
for the biting wind that blows from the top of
Alaska’s Coast Range and bears company with the
wayfarer down in the valley of the Yukon past the
lakes and into the gold camps of the Klondike.</p>

<p>Well, all this came to me then as I realized that
Swiftwater was gone North once more in search<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
of gold, but, with Bera in Seattle and the two
babies, I was shackled as securely as any one of the
wretches who walk the streets of this city with
chains and ball working out a sentence for
vagrancy.</p>

<p>It is not a less remarkable thing to be told of
Swiftwater that he turned Dame Fortune’s wheel
once more with the dial pointing in his direction as
quickly as he had raised the necessary money in San
Francisco to make a new start in Fairbanks. To
all who know of Swiftwater’s kaleidoscopic changes
from rich to poor, and back again to rich, it seems
as if the fickle Dame, carrying a magic horn spilling
gold in all directions, followed Swiftwater wherever
he went into Alaska and out again, down to the
cities of the States and back again, and, if she
seemed to lose him for a while, always to welcome
him back with a winning smile.</p>

<p>Of course, it is part of my story that after Swiftwater
had amassed another fortune on Cleary Creek,
in the Tanana, and his friend, Mr. Marks, who had
grubstake him, sought to obtain his rights in the
property, it was found that the contract between
them written by Swiftwater was as full of holes as
a sieve. Again the lawyers went to work earning
big fees in the litigation which Marks brought to
compel Swiftwater to do the honorable thing&mdash;to
do that by him which any man in Alaska, at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
while he lived there, never failed to do&mdash;to divide
with the man who grubstaked him.</p>

<p>Now, Swiftwater, as my reader has by this time
safely guessed, was made in a different mould. They
used to say in the early days when the stories of
the incredible richness of Eldorado’s gold lined
bedrock were told on the “outside,” that when a
man in Alaska drank the water of the country, the
truth left him. I have never, for my own part, fully
determined whether this is true, and I may frankly
say that in some of my experiences, the opportunities
for judging of the truth or falsity of this theory
were limited, the reason being that most of the men
drink something beside water in that country.</p>

<p>As for Swiftwater Bill, he never did drink anything
but water&mdash;I never knew him to take a drop
of any intoxicating liquors or wine&mdash;so that if the
water of Alaska had any demoralizing effect on
Swiftwater, it must have been in the direction of
his sense of business honor and integrity and a
decent sense of his obligations as a husband and
a father. And I am satisfied, too, that the water
of Alaska, if such was the demoralizing agent in
Swiftwater’s case, certainly worked terrific havoc.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">SWIFTWATER BILL had struck it
again.</p>

<p>On Number 6 Cleary Creek, in the
Tanana, the man who gained his
chiefest fame in the early days of
Dawson by walking around the rapids
of Miles Canyon, because he was afraid to navigate
them, thereby earning his cognomen, “Swiftwater
Bill,” had found another fortune in the yellow
gold that lines countless tens of thousands of little
creeks and dry gulches in that great northern
country&mdash;Alaska.</p>

<p>Swiftwater had obtained a big working interest
in the mine on Cleary Creek, a stream that has
produced its millions in yellow gold. And, after
the first discovery of placer gold in paying quantities
in the Tanana, the whole Western coast of the
American continent knew the story. Like Dawson,
the town of Fairbanks quickly sprang from the soil
as if reared by the magic of some unseen genii of
the Arabian Nights.</p>

<p>Of course, the word came out to me in a letter
from a friend at Fairbanks. And I sometimes think
that, after all, I must have had a great many friends
in Alaska who remembered the hard task that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
fates had put upon me when they made me, through
no wish of my own, the mother-in-law of Swiftwater
Bill.</p>

<p>As I remember now, the news that Swiftwater
had struck another pay streak impressed upon me
the necessity of immediate action. Swiftwater’s
previous conduct, particularly that $100 dinner that
he gave in Seattle a few months before, had taught
me one thing, and that was that if Gates was ever
to do the square thing by me and by Bera and
the babies it would be only when some one with
sufficient will power to accomplish the task would
reach him and see that he did not forget his duty.</p>

<p>Now, it is no May day holiday for a woman to
“mush” over the ice from the coast of Alaska to
the interior mining camps. First you have to get
an outfit in Seattle, and by that I mean sufficient
heavy underclothing, outer clothing, heavy boots,
furs and sleeping bag and the like to make travel
over the ice comfortable. Ten years ago any woman
who made that journey&mdash;that is, from Dyea over the
mountain passes covered with glaciers and thence
down the Upper Yukon on the ice&mdash;was considered
almost as a heroine and the newspapers were eager
to print the stories of such exploits. When I determined
to go into the Tanana to find Swiftwater
mining gold on Number 6 Cleary there were few,
if any, of the comforts of present-day winter travel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
on the Valdez-Fairbanks trail, such as horse stages
and frequent road-houses.</p>

<p>Consequently, I determined to follow the old
route, and I went to Skagway, thence over the White
Pass road to White Horse and, crossing Lake Le
Barge on the ice, there to await the departure for
Dawson of the first down river steamer.</p>

<p>It was in the early spring of the year&mdash;that is,
early for Alaska, although when I left Seattle the
orchards were in bloom and lawns were as green
as in mid-summer. Lake Le Barge was still frozen
over, and the upper waters of the Yukon
were beginning to show their first gigantic
unrest of that spring&mdash;a mighty unrest that carries
with it the movement of vast ice gorges down the
canyon of the Upper Yukon to the Klondike, and
which, if suddenly halted on its way to the sea by
an unexpected drop in temperature, is likely to work
havoc with men and property and sometimes human
lives.</p>

<p>The Yukon River is not like any other stream
on the American continent with which you and I are
familiar. It seems to be a thing alive when the
spring sun begins to loosen the icy chains that bind
it hard and fast to old Mother Earth through eight
long and dreary winter months. No greater phenomena
of nature, showing the change that spring
brings to all forms of life&mdash;human, animal and plant&mdash;is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
to be found anywhere than the awakening of
the Yukon River after her voiceless sleep.</p>

<p>At White Horse the freight for Dawson and
the Tanana mines was stacked twenty feet high
in all directions when we boarded the first steamer
and followed the ice jam down the river to Dawson.
Eventually, on a little steamer that plied between
Dawson and Fairbanks when the ice is far enough
gone to make navigation safe, I made my way to the
chief mining camp of the Tanana&mdash;Fairbanks,
named after the vice-president, who visited the
North when he was a senator from Indiana.</p>

<p>I had no trouble in finding Gates.</p>

<p>“Swiftwater,” I said, “I am here to have you
provide for your wife and children, and to pay at
least part of what you owe me.”</p>

<p>Bill was courteous, suave, obliging and well mannered.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Beebe,” said Bill, “at last I am fixed so
that I can do the right thing by you and all others.
As soon as I can make my last payment on my
Cleary Creek property, I will square everything up,
and give you plenty of money for Bera and the
boys.”</p>

<p>Now, I know that everyone who reads this little
book will say to themselves:</p>

<p>“If Mrs. Beebe don’t get her money now, she
certainly is foolish.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Swiftwater, to be sure, saw that my hotel bills
were paid and told me every day that in a short
time he would clean up enough gold to make himself
independent, and provide bountifully for Bera
and the two boys&mdash;and I believed him.</p>

<p>Swiftwater’s sister, the mother of Kitty, his polygamous
wife, was, I quickly learned, living in a
tent on Bill’s claim, waiting to lay hold of him
and his money as soon as the clean-up was finished.
Long before this he had deserted Kitty, and in all
the turmoil and trouble that came after his bigamous
marriage to his niece I had lost all track of that
unfortunate girl.</p>

<p>I remember now how odd it struck me that Swiftwater’s
sister was there, living in a little white
canvas tent, and enduring the privations which any
woman must suffer in that country, while I, actuated
by the same desire, was waiting for Swiftwater to
finish washing up the dumps on his claims. And I
recalled at the time that when Swiftwater mined
thousands of gold from his claims in the Klondike
he allowed his own mother to cook in a cabin of a
miner on a claim not far from his own, and although
rich beyond his fondest dreams had permitted that
poor woman to earn her own living by the hardest
kind of drudgery and toil.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi">SWIFTWATER’S clean-up on Number 6
Cleary Creek was $75,000 in gold.
The summer was come to an end and
there were signs on the trees, in
the crackling of the frosted grass in
the early morning and in the bite of
the night wind from the mountain canyons that told
of the quick approach of winter in the Tanana.
Swiftwater had been more than usually fortunate.
His mine on Number 6 Cleary had yielded far beyond
his expectations. Swiftwater had every reason
to believe his friends who told him that his luck
was phenomenal.</p>

<p>As there are compensating advantages and disadvantages
in almost every phase of human life in
this world, it may possibly be said that as an offset
to Swiftwater’s phenomenal luck, he had two
women, the mothers of his two wives, waiting patiently
at Fairbanks for him to bring out enough
money to properly provide for his families. I had
told Swiftwater:</p>

<p>“I am up here to take good care of you, Bill, and
incidentally to see that you provide enough money
to feed and clothe your children and your wife. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
don’t care anything about that other woman over
there.”</p>

<p>Bill laughed, and said it was probably a lucky
thing for him that he had a mother-in-law to look
after his welfare. But if Swiftwater’s mind ever
hovered around the idea of criminal proceedings on
the score of bigamy, he did not give voice to it. He
merely went around in his cheerful way from day
to day working vigorously with his men until, finally,
early in September, the last of the pay dirt was
washed from the dumps into the sluice boxes and
the gold sacked and taken to the bank.</p>

<p>Then Bill began paying off his debts. He settled
with his partners, and then with a big chunk of bills
and drafts in his inside pocket we started for
Seattle.</p>

<p>It was getting winter rapidly and we had no time
to lose in order to catch the steamship “Ohio,” at
St. Michael, for Seattle, before the winter freeze-up
on Bering Sea.</p>

<p>Swiftwater, while working on Number 6 Cleary,
had been all business and activity. Now, he seemed
on the little boat going down the Tanana to be his
old self again&mdash;by that I mean that Swiftwater reverted
to his conduct of early days, which had lead
some people to believe that he was descended from
the Mormon stock back in Utah. Why Swiftwater
had never earned the title of the Brigham Young of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the Klondike instead of the Knight of the Golden
Omelette or just plain Swiftwater, I never could
quite understand.</p>

<p>At Fairbanks Swiftwater induced a woman, whose
name I shall not give at this time, to board the
steamer for the outside. A half day’s further ride
took us to Chena, and there Swiftwater met another
friend by the name of Violet&mdash;a girl who had worked
as housekeeper and cook for a crowd of miners during
the summer because her husband had deserted
her and left her penniless in Fairbanks.</p>

<p>This Violet was young and comely, and of gentle
breeding. The hard life in the mining camps of
the Yukon and the bitterness she had suffered at
the hands of her truant husband had taken a little
of the natural refinement from the girl and had
probably shaped her life so that the better side could
not be seen.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, Violet came with Swiftwater,
but, when she found on the steamship “Ohio” that
Swiftwater had tipped one of the crew $100 so as
to enable him to have a seat with a woman on each
side of him at his meals, Violet refused to have
anything to do with him.</p>

<p>At St. Michael, when I found that Swiftwater
thought more of the association of women and of
having his kind of a good time than of providing for
his wife and children, I made up my mind that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
would have to be a showdown of some kind. I
telegraphed to Bera at Seattle:</p>

<p>“Swiftwater is coming down on the Ohio. You
had better see him now, if you want anything.”</p>

<p>We were nine days making the trip from St.
Michael to Seattle. When the crowd on the boat
learned that Swiftwater Bill was on board, everybody
looked for fireworks and a good time. The
captain ordered notice put up in the dining room,
reading:</p>

<p>“Gambling positively prohibited on this boat.”</p>

<p>Swiftwater saw that sign and gently laughed to
himself.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Beebe,” he said, “I am going to have
some fun with the boys. So if I come to borrow
some money from you, don’t be foolish and refuse
me.”</p>

<p>Swiftwater had some few hundred in cash, but
most of his money was in drafts, which he could not
cash on the boat. When I found that the boys
had started a little poker game, I expected Swiftwater
to be coming to me for money in a little
while, and sure enough he did.</p>

<p>“Swiftwater,” I said, “as long as you play poker
you can’t have any money from me, because you
know you can’t play poker. But if you will start
a solo game I will let you have a little change.”</p>

<p>Now, Swiftwater swelled up visibly because he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
knew that I thought he was one of the best solo
players in all the North, and I have to laugh even
now to recall that after the first fifteen minutes of
play at solo the men who had sought to fleece him
of his money, found they had no chance and they
all stopped the game.</p>

<p>It was late Saturday afternoon when finally the
Ohio poked her nose in front of one of the docks
in Seattle. There was a strong ebb tide, and it was
nearly an hour before the gang plank was run
ashore. We docked jam up against a little steamer
on our left, and Swiftwater, being in a hurry to
get ashore, asked me if I would take his grip in the
carriage to the Cecil Hotel and he would join me in
a little while, after he could get a shave. With
that Swiftwater jumped to the deck of the little
steamer next to us and thence to the dock and was
gone.</p>

<p>I went direct to the Cecil Hotel, where Bera was
waiting for me. Before I had been there a half
hour the newsboys on the streets were crying the
sale of the Seattle Times:</p>

<p>“All about Swiftwater Bill arrested for bigamy.”</p>

<p>I heard the shrill voices of the urchins from my
window in the hotel and I said:</p>

<p>“Bera, what have you done&mdash;had him arrested?”</p>

<p>I rang the bell and told the bell-boy to bring up
a copy of The Times. Sure enough, there was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
whole story of a warrant issued for Swiftwater Bill
on the charge of bigamy and a long yarn about his
various escapes in Alaska, including a recital of how
he ruined the life of young Kitty Gates, his niece,
by eloping with her and marrying her while he was
still the lawful husband of Bera.</p>

<p>Just about dusk&mdash;I think it must have been at 8
o’clock that evening&mdash;there came a knock at the
door. I went to answer it, and there in the hall of
the hotel stood a man who was an absolute stranger
to me.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Beebe?”</p>

<p>“This is Mrs. Beebe.”</p>

<p>“Swiftwater wants to see you. I am Jack Watson,
who used to be with him in the north.”</p>

<p>“Where is he?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you where he is, Mrs. Beebe,” said
the man, “but if you will go with me I can find
him.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later we were on First Avenue,
which was crowded with thousands of sightseers,
it being Saturday night, and everybody seemed to
be out for a good time. Watson led me up Spring
Street to the alley between First and Second Avenues
and then went down the alley till, reaching
the shadow of a tall building, he said:</p>

<p>“Please wait here a minute, Mrs. Beebe.”</p>

<p>I looked down at the brilliantly lighted street corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
on First Avenue, where is situated the Rainier-Grand
Hotel, and there I saw Swiftwater standing,
smoking a cigar, while hundreds of people were
passing up and down the sidewalk. He little
looked as if the deputy sheriffs were after him.</p>

<p>In a moment Watson had brought Swiftwater to
me.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Beebe,” said Swiftwater, “what did you
wire to Bera? Did you tell her I was coming out
and to have me arrested?”</p>

<p>“I certainly wired her,” said I, “and, Swiftwater,
if she’s had you arrested that’s your business.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Beebe, you’ve been the only friend I’ve
ever had and now you have thrown me down,” said
the miner.</p>

<p>Said I, “Swiftwater, I have not thrown you down,
and it’s about time that you showed some indication
of trying to do what is right by me and Bera and
the babies.”</p>

<p>“Here’s that $250 I borrowed from you on the
boat,” said Swiftwater, “and I guess after all that
you are really the only friend I ever had in this
world. Won’t you tell me what to do now?”</p>

<p>I hesitated a moment and then it seemed to
me that there was little to be gained by having
Swiftwater thrown into jail without any chance
whatever to secure his release on bail. In spite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of all that I had suffered from him, and all the
untold misery and humiliation that he had put upon
my daughter Bera, I felt sorry for Swiftwater.</p>

<p>“You had better take this $250 back,” said I,
“as you may have to get out of town tonight. Have
you any other money on you?”</p>

<p>“Not a cent,” said he.</p>

<p>“Very well, you can pay me that money you
owe some other time,” I said.</p>

<p>Then Swiftwater and I fell to talking as to what
had best be done. He wanted very much to see
Bera and the babies and begged me, if I thought it
safe, to take him to the hotel. Finally, seeing the
big crowd on the streets, I consented, and together
we went to the Cecil, entered the elevator and then
went directly to my rooms.</p>

<p>Bera was there with the boy Freddie&mdash;the youngest.
Swiftwater kissed Bera and the baby, but
Bera turned away and went into another room, the
tears streaming down her face.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Beebe,” said Swiftwater, “the penitentiary
will be my fate unless this bigamy charge is withdrawn.
You and Bera and the babies will lose if
I go to state’s prison, and that is where Kitty Gates
will send me unless Bera will get a divorce.”</p>

<p>Just then there came a loud rap at the door, and
without waiting for either of us to speak the door
was opened and in walked two deputy sheriffs. They
immediately placed Swiftwater under arrest.</p>

<p class="drop-capi160">AS A VERACIOUS chronicler of the
events, inexplicable and unbelievable
as this story may appear, of the life
and exploits of Swiftwater Bill Gates,
I want to begin this chapter with the
prefatory announcement that, all and
singular, as the lawyers say, the statements herein
are absolutely true and may be verified.</p>

<p>I give this simple warning merely because, as I
recall what happened the next two or three days
after Swiftwater’s arrest, it seems to me that many
of my readers will say, “These things could not have
happened.”</p>

<p>Swiftwater, calmly seating himself, in a big leather
upholstered Morris chair, said, looking at the
Sheriff; “Old man, I guess we can fix this thing
up right here. Send for the judge and have him
come down here quick.”</p>

<p>The officer looked at me and smiled.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to see Mr. Gates put in jail tonight”
said I. “And if there is any way that this
thing can be settled I am willing. More than that,”
and here I looked at Swiftwater, “I think Bill will
not make any attempt to escape, and if it is all right
with you, I’ll go on his bond.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>After more palaver of this kind, and here I am
about to tell something about judicial processes
that will surely cause a smile, a messenger was sent
from the hotel to another hotel, where was stopping
Judge Hatch, who was sitting on the Superior
Court bench in King County, although he lived in
another county down the Sound.</p>

<p>Outside in the hall there were a score of people,
waiting to see Swiftwater, and to learn what would
be the outcome of the case. There was the sheriff,
Lou Smith; two other deputies, a half dozen lawyers
and the reporters for the Seattle newspapers&mdash;quite
a colony altogether.</p>

<p>After half an hour the judge came in the room,
accompanied by another deputy sheriff.</p>

<p>“We’d just as well have some of the lawyers in
here,” said Swiftwater. “Ask Mr. Murphy and
Mr. Cole to come in.”</p>

<p>The door was opened and in came the attorneys
and some others.</p>

<p>“Will you please ring the bell, Mrs. Beebe?” said
Swiftwater.</p>

<p>I rang the bell, the boy came and Swiftwater ordered
two pint bottles of wine.</p>

<p>Now, this was Swiftwater’s way of dallying with
justice. It was another exemplification of his idea&mdash;the
mainspring in the man’s whole character&mdash;that
money could do anything and everything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>The wine came, two bottles at a time and then
four, and then six. Every time the boy came up,
Swiftwater borrowed money from me to pay the
bill. Then Swiftwater did something that I never
believed could happen. The National Bank at Fairbanks
had, a few weeks before, issued its first currency&mdash;the
first government bank notes in all
Alaska. Swiftwater had a bunch of the new $20
bills and, wrapping in each a nugget taken from
Number 6 Cleary, he presented one to each of his
friends&mdash;that is, all who were present.</p>

<p>“If Mr. Gates will deposit $2,250, as counsel for
Mrs. Gates desires, which is to be applied for the
maintenance of herself and children and for attorney’s
fees, I think we may continue this matter until
a later date,” said the judge.</p>

<p>Swiftwater came over to me.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a thousand dollar draft,” said he, “and
if you will loan me $1,250 I’ll pay everything up
Monday,” said Swiftwater.</p>

<p>I have never yet fully made up my mind what led
me to loan Swiftwater that money, unless it was
that, like everyone else who knew of his wonderful
capacity for getting money rapidly out of the North,
I believed he would make good all of his promises.
I gave him the money, and Swiftwater was a free
man.</p>

<p>Just then the sheriff himself opened the door and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
noticing one of the lawyers holding a bunch of bills
and drafts in his hand, said:</p>

<p>“I guess I will take charge of this.”</p>

<p>And so it came about that the money was deposited
in the clerk’s office in the county court, and on
Monday morning, before any of us were about, the
lawyers for Bera, Murphy &amp; Cole, appeared in the
courthouse with an order signed by the judge to
draw the money out. Bera got $750 of the $1,000
promised her for maintenance for herself and children
and the lawyers got the remainder.</p>

<p>Is it any wonder, then, that I have often thought
it was the easiest thing in the world for Swiftwater
to find a loophole in the meshes of the law by which
he could escape, while I have never yet found a
way to make the law give me just common justice?</p>

<p>And now it was Swiftwater’s turn to act. In
another day the newspapers had his story that he
had been “held up,” and after that came a sensation
in the Bar Association of Seattle the like of which
is not on record. And while the lawyers were fighting
over the spoils, Swiftwater cleverly enough,
though haunted by the spectre of the state prison,
and constantly pressed by Kitty Gates, his polygamous
wife, began working on Bera’s sympathies. He
came to the hotel and went to Bera’s room.</p>

<p>“Bera,” he said, “unless you get a divorce from
me, and do it at once, Kitty will send me to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
penitentiary; I will lose all my property in Alaska,
and the boys and you will be everlastingly disgraced.”</p>

<p>Bera listened. It is enough to say that with
Swiftwater in the penitentiary, his mining interests
in Alaska, which promised brighter than anything
he had ever undertaken, and that means hundreds
of thousands of dollars, all of Bera’s chance and
mine to ever get a new start in life would have
been wasted.</p>

<p>Swiftwater daily said:</p>

<p>“Bera, you certainly love the boys enough to save
them the disgrace of having a felon for a father.”</p>

<p>The argument was enough. Bera consented, and
although, as I understand it, the law specifically
prohibits a divorce where the parties agree in advance
on the severance of the holy marriage tie,
Swiftwater went away and Bera brought suit for
divorce in the court of King County. And in time
the decree was granted and is still of record in that
county.</p>

<p>A week later Swiftwater, as I afterwards found
out, joined Kitty Gates in Portland and the two
went to San Francisco. Thus can be turned into the
basest uses the legal processes of our courts and,
strange as it may seem, Swiftwater, after Bera’s divorce,
legally married Kitty, then divorced her, and
not later than two years afterwards he told the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
newspapers in San Francisco, that having divorced
all his other wives, he was looking for a new one.</p>

<p>I want to ask now, is there no law to reach a
monster of this kind? Are the laws so framed that
men of Swiftwater’s type can go at large throughout
the country ruining the lives of young girls, and,
followed by a halo of gold and the fame that quick
fortune making brings, claiming and receiving the
friendship of their fellow men?</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dci09_17.jpg" width="80" height="139" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi">I AM getting to the end of my story, and as the
finish draws near, it seems to me, that I have
not quite done justice by Swiftwater Bill, in
at least one respect&mdash;and that is the activity
and agility the man displays when events over
which he might have had control, had he been on
the square, crowded him so closely, that like the
proverbial flea, he had to hike. And in telling of
Swiftwater’s talent in this direction, I wish to be regarded
as speaking as one without malice, but rather
as admiring Swiftwater for trying, in so far as lay in
his power, to make good his nickname of Swiftwater.</p>

<p>In San Francisco, after Swiftwater had obtained
a divorce from Kitty, he immediately announced his
intention of getting another wife. For Swiftwater
knew that the prison gates which once had yawned
in his face were now closed, and, better even than
that, was the thought that I&mdash;his loving mother-in-law&mdash;would
no longer be interested in his future.</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly true that in Swiftwater’s mental
processes he regarded first, the hundreds of thousands
of dollars in gold that lay in the pay streak
on No. 6 Cleary, in the Tanana, and I can see Bill
now in my mind’s eye, facing an array of cut glass
decanters, embroidered table cloths, potted plants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
orchestra and all that goes with the swell cafes of
San Francisco, eating his dinner and rubbing his
hands with glee as he remembered how easily he had
obtained a fortune from me, which he sunk on
Quartz Creek in the Klondike, and then slid out of
paying his debt to me.</p>

<p>The very next season found Swiftwater in the
Tanana and this time, according to the best official
records I could obtain, his clean-up was not less
than $200,000. But I had not forgotten that Swiftwater
had told me, first that Number 6 Cleary was
a bigger proposition even than Quartz Creek, and
that Gold Stream was one of the richest of all the
undeveloped creeks in the whole Tanana.</p>

<p>For this last information, I will say, I have always
been grateful to Swiftwater, because his belief
that the time would come when Gold Stream
would be one of the best producers in all Alaska,
led me to obtain several claims there. And now, let
it be known, his prediction has been fully and completely
verified.</p>

<p>But, knowing nothing of Gold Stream, and remembering
only that Swiftwater had added more than
$1,000 to his already great obligations to me, and had
provided nothing for his family, I journeyed once
more across the Coast Range of Alaska.</p>

<p>Crossing on the railway from Skagway to White
Horse, I met a score or more of traders with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
outfits of provisions and fresh vegetables, all hurrying
to get into Dawson as soon as the ice broke
up, to sell their wares to the miners of the Klondike
at fancy prices. There were several women in the
party, some of them bent on joining their husbands
in Dawson.</p>

<p>Three hours ride down the river on a scow, laden
with freight of every character, we struck a sand
bar and were compelled to spent the night in midstream,
absolutely without even a crust of bread to
eat, and heaven’s blue our only canopy. The
grounding of freight scows in the upper waters of
the Yukon in the spring is a common experience,
and in those days little care was taken to protect the
passengers from suffering hardship and real danger.
That night the icy winds blew from the mountain
ranges sixty miles an hour, and we suffered severely,
not having a mouthful of food since the morning
before.</p>

<p>The captain of the scow, oblivious to his obligations
to his passengers, had loaned the only small
boat he had to a pair of miners the day before.
We could do nothing until they returned. Finally,
after we had been on the bar for more than twelve
hours, the men came back with the boat and took
us, two at a time, ashore.</p>

<p>Then, guided by traders, the women in the party
were told to walk down the stream fifteen miles to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
where there was a camp. It was bitter cold and
the trail was hard to walk. In the afternoon of the
day following our shipwreck, we stopped and the men
built a bonfire, while the poor women fell almost
unconscious in front of it, completely exhausted
for want of food, which we had not tasted for
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Two of the traders went down to the river’s
bank and on the other side they espied a camp of
a herder, beneath the shelter of an abandoned barracks.
This was the only human habitation within
miles. The traders procured a boat and took us
women across the river. The herder had some bacon
and some dry bread, which he cooked for us.
Now, I want to say that never in my life have I ever
eaten anything that tasted so good as that meal, consisting
only of fried bacon strips placed with the
gravy on top of two slices of cold dry bread, and a
teacup of hot coffee to wash it down with.</p>

<p>That day the scow came down the river and again
we boarded it and finally reached Lake Le Barge.
The lake was still frozen over and we started to
cross its thirty miles of icy surface with horses drawing
sleds. The ice was getting rotten and four
times in as many miles, to my constant terror, the
horses broke through the ice, threatening every minute
to drag me with them. Becoming weary of this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
I left the sled and hired a dog team and outfit to
take me across the lake.</p>

<p>At Clark’s road house, I remained a week and
then boarded a scow and went through Thirty-Mile
river to board the steamer Thistle for Dawson. Going
down the river on a scow, one scow that was
lashed to ours, struck a rock in midstream, a hole
was knocked into our scow, which almost sunk.
The bank of the river was lined with thousands of
people camping or moving on towards the Klondike.
These people came to our rescue and with ropes and
small boats helped us off.</p>

<p>In Fairbanks once more, I found Swiftwater. I
had telephoned him of my coming, and in a day or
two he came to my hotel.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Beebe,” he said, “here is $50 for your
present hotel bills. I must go back to Cleary Creek
at once, but I will be back again inside of a week,
and then I will straighten everything up.”</p>

<p>When Swiftwater told me that, I believed him&mdash;for
the last time&mdash;for the next morning I found that
he had left my room to board a train for Chena, on
the Tanana, with a draft for $50,000 in his inside
pocket, $10,000 more in cash and a ticket for Seattle.</p>

<p>Swiftwater undoubtedly believed, that being without
money I would be compelled to remain an unlimited
time in Fairbanks. Not so. I still had a
little jewelry left that he had not persuaded me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
pawn or sell for his benefit, and on this I raised
enough money to buy a ticket to Seattle.</p>

<p>Before I could get there, Swiftwater learned of
my coming, and when I arrived on Elliott Bay,
he had applied to the Federal Courts to be
adjudged a bankrupt and had assigned to Phil Wilson
all his interests in the Tanana, amounting to
untold wealth.</p>

<p>That case of Swiftwater’s is still pending in the
Federal Court in Seattle, and no judge and no court
has ever yet, up to this writing, consented to declare
him a bankrupt, although he has successfully
placed his property in the Tanana beyond the reach
of the scores of men who have befriended him in
the past without reward on his part.</p>

<p class="drop-capi170">AGAIN it is spring, and I sit all alone in
my room in Seattle, knowing that the
city is filled with miners, their faces
set in the direction of the Golden North,
their hearts beating with high hopes, their breasts
swelling with the happy purpose of getting back
once more to the glacier bound, gold lined gravel
beds of Alaska&mdash;the treasure land of the world. I
know that I cannot go with them, for Swiftwater
has robbed me of almost every farthing I ever possessed.</p>

<p>I read in the Seattle papers that scores of the
old-timers are in the hotels down town, laying up
stores of supplies, mining outfits, etc., ready for a
big summer’s season of work in the north, of digging
far below the surface to the eternally frozen bedrock,
in search of the only thing which is imperishable
among all the perishable things of this earth&mdash;GOLD.
I can see them thronging the hotel lobbies, the bars,
and the cafes&mdash;great, burly, broad-shouldered, big-chested
men of the North&mdash;the bone and sinew of the
greatest gold-producing country in the world.</p>

<p>Many have bought their tickets and stateroom
reservations for the first Nome steamers, weeks in
advance, unmindful of the fact that their ship must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
plough her dangerous way through great icebergs
and ice floes in Bering Sea. Scores of others are
planning to take the first boats of the spring season,
while yet winter lingers with heavy hand on Alaska’s
coast and inland valleys, on their way to Valdez and
thence over the ice to the Tanana, four hundred
miles away. No thought of cold, or hardship, or
danger deters any of these men, and even women,
because they know at the end of the journey their
mission will not be valueless, and that for at least a
great proportion of them there will be a real shining
pot of gold at the end of their rainbow of hope&mdash;where’er
they find it&mdash;even though they must needs
go as far as the rim of the Arctic Circle.</p>

<p>Many of my friends tell me that Swiftwater’s life
story, as I have set it down here, recounting only the
facts, sparing nothing, adding nothing, will be eagerly
read by tens of thousands of Alaska people. If
this is true, then will Swiftwater be known in his
true light to all that multitude of adventurous men
and women of the North, who come and go through
Seattle, fall and spring, spring and fall, like the
myriads of Alaska’s water fowl who seek the sunny
South in October, to speed their way north again in
the spring, the moment the ice floes in the headwaters
of the Yukon are gone.</p>

<p>And now, as I survey my work, I am moved to
ask all who read, if they can answer this question:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>“What manner of man, in Heaven’s name, is this
Swiftwater Bill Gates?”</p>

<p>Yes, what manner of man, or other creature is
Swiftwater? Perhaps some people will say that
when Swiftwater Bill, down deep in his prospect
hole on Eldorado, looked upon the glittering drift
of gold that covered the bedrock, the glamor of that
shining mass gave him a sort of moral blindness,
from which he has never recovered. It is possible
that the lure of gold, which he had seen in such
boundless quantities, had so entered into his very
soul that all sense of his duty and obligations as a
man may have been dwarfed or utterly eliminated.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, Swiftwater, after he had placed
his properties on Cleary Creek in the hands of Phil
Wilson, so that his creditors could not lay hands on
any of his money or by any means satisfy their just
debts, went down into Nevada and plunged heavily
in Rawhide and Goldfield properties. Rumors
reached me many times that Swiftwater has made
another fortune, and the San Francisco papers
printed such stories about him. His property on
Number 6 Cleary is still a big producer of gold,
and it seems that by merely turning his hands,
Swiftwater could, within a few months, pile up
enough money to make happy those who have innocently
suffered such grievous wrong at his hands.
And here my heart grows hard as I think of the
farce of the law&mdash;how fine are its meshes if an innocent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
person is taken&mdash;how wide are its loop holes
when the smooth and oily crook with money becomes
entangled therein.</p>

<p>For why is it, that the courts will suffer a lecherous
monster to go abroad in the land, to marry and
re-marry without paying the slightest heed to the
restrictions of the law; to abduct, seduce and then
abandon young girls and leave them penniless and
deserted in unknown lands?</p>

<p>And, why is it that such men can, by using heavy
tips of gold, weigh down the hands of the sworn
officers of the law, manage to slip unharmed and
unhampered through counties and states where the
processes in bankruptcy and in criminal proceeding,
issued by the courts of law, are out against them?</p>

<p>Why is it, then, that a man like Swiftwater could
come to Seattle at night locked in the drawing room
of a Pullman car, be taken swiftly in a closed carriage
to a steamer bound for Valdez, and remain
hidden in his stateroom on board the boat for two
days before the ship sailed, while deputy sheriffs
were scouring the town to compel him to provide
from the ample money he had, food and clothing
for the wife and babies he had deserted?</p>

<p>Perhaps, after all, Swiftwater’s belief that the
power of gold is omnipotent, may be the true and
right one. Gold in the hands of such a man is a
monstrous implement of crime, of degeneration to
women and to innocent children.</p>

<p class="drop-capi185">MAMA, don’t you think you can have
some fireworks on the Fourth of July
and come out to the Brothers School
so that we can celebrate?”</p>

<p>Little Freddie Gates, Swiftwater’s youngest boy,
looked up in my face with the dearest kind of a
smile, and put his arm on my shoulder. The little
fellow had just had his night bath in my room and
had put on his fresh, clean, white pajamas, ready for
bed.</p>

<p>It was Saturday before the Fourth of July and
Freddie knew that I might not be able to spend
Sunday with him at the Brothers School&mdash;which
was the first Sunday since Freddie was taken there
that I had not spent the day with him.</p>

<p>Now, it may seem odd to you and all the rest
who have followed the story of Swiftwater’s fortunes
and misfortunes, that I have never told you about
the two dear little boys&mdash;Bera’s children&mdash;who all
these years have been without a father’s care and
who call their Grandma “Mama.”</p>

<p>And this brings me to the story of how Clifford,
the child who first saw the light of day on Gold
Quartz Creek in order to satisfy his father’s pride,
as I have already told, was stolen from me by Lena
Hubbell, the nurse. Clifford is the oldest boy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the two, and as dear a little fellow and as manly
and straightforward and handsome as any boy you
ever saw in your life. When the papers in Seattle
told of Swiftwater making a big strike in the Tanana,
Bera and I and all of us felt that at last there
would be a brighter dawning and a better day, and
an end of the drudgery and sacrifice and slavish toil
which had been our portion.</p>

<p>A day or two after the story of Swiftwater’s gold
find came over the wires, Lena, into whose custody
I had placed Clifford, came to me saying:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Beebe, if you don’t care, I’d like to take
Clifford on a little trip of two or three weeks to Mt.
Vernon. I have some friends there and I need a
vacation and a rest.”</p>

<p>I had befriended Lena in the North and had done
everything I could for her. I trusted the girl implicitly
and it is not to be wondered at that I quickly
gave her permission to take Clifford with her to
Mt. Vernon, which is only a half day’s ride or less
from Seattle.</p>

<p>I told Lena to take good care of the child and be
sure that she wrote me every few days&mdash;and this
she promised to do.</p>

<p>Two weeks went by and I heard no word from
Lena. I feared the child might be ill and wrote
and then telegraphed without receiving an answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
to either. The last letter was returned to me unopened.</p>

<p>That afternoon I took the last train for Mt. Vernon,
and before I went to bed in the little hotel there,
I found that my worst fears were true&mdash;Lena had
left, leaving no address, and had taken Clifford with
her. Later, I found she had taken the boy to Canada.</p>

<p>I have not heard directly from Lena and Clifford,
although I know what fate has befallen the boy,
and that he is alive and well. Of course, I do not
know that Lena Hubbell deliberately planned to
kidnap Clifford, believing that his father, when he
had amassed another fortune, would pay a large sum
for his recovery.</p>

<p>As soon as I had found in Fairbanks that Swiftwater
was coming out, I urged him then and there,
with all the power and earnestness at my command,
to send an officer for Lena Hubbell and the child
into Canada and bring the boy home.</p>

<p>Swiftwater has not spent a dollar in this endeavor,
although it has cost me several hundred dollars in
futile efforts to bring the boy home.</p>

<p>Those two boys&mdash;Clifford and Freddie&mdash;are all
that I have left in this world to live for. Freddie
is seven years old, bright, plump, well developed
and very affectionate. It is said of him that he
learns very quickly and remembers well, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
dear Fathers at the Brothers School at South Park,
who have taken care of him, fed him and clothed him
for months without a dollar of Swiftwater’s money,
say that he will some day make a name in the world.</p>

<p>And now, I am going to take you, my reader, into
my confidence and tell you something that is sacred.
These boys, I feel, are my own flesh and blood&mdash;my
own boys.</p>

<p>If my story will throw some new light on the
hardships of women who are forced to go to the
North in search of a livelihood or shall be read with
interest by all my old friends in Alaska, I shall
rest content. I have a mission to perform&mdash;the care
and education of my two boys&mdash;Clifford and Freddie.</p>
